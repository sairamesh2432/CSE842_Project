Hello
You know you gotta pay for that, right?
Hey
Come on
Not OK!
We got ourself an X-Men fan
Maybe a quarter of what happened...
...but not like this
In the real world people die
- Logan - I don't want to talk about it
- Logan -Just stop!
Be careful...
I need the girl
What girl?
Go get her
No
No
No!
She's like you
Very much like you
I am not whatever it is you think I am
She needs our help
Someone will come along
Someone has come along
This is what life looks like
People who love each other
A home
You should take a moment
Feel it
You still have time
