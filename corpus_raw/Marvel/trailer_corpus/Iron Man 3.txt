I've got a lot of apologies to make.
Nothing has been the same since New York.
You experience things, and then they're over.
I can't sleep.
And when I do, I have nightmares.
Honestly, there's a hundred people who wanna kill me.
I hope I can protect the one thing I can't live without.
Ladies.
Children.
Sheep.
Some people call me a terrorist.
I consider myself a teacher.
Lesson number one.
Heroes ... there is no such thing.
