Buck
Do you remember me?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
And you used to wear newspapers in your shoes
You're a wanted man.
I don't do that anymore.
Well, the people who think you did are coming right now...
...and they're not planning on taking you alive.
Captain
While a great many people see you as a hero...
...there are some who prefer the word vigilante.
You have operated with unlimited power and no supervision.
That's something the world can no longer tolerate.
I know how much Bucky means to you.
Stay out of this one,
please.
You will only make this worse.
You're saying you'll arrest me?
There will be consequences.
Captain... You seem a little defensive.
Well, it's been a long day.
If we can't accept limitations, we're no better than bad guys.
That's not the way I see it.
I am so tempted, I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth.
I just wanna make sure we consider all our options.
Cause people who shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me, too.
You know what's about to happen?
Do you really want to punch your way out of this?
What do we do?
We fight.
Sorry Tony.
You know I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice,
but he's my friend.
So was I.
