So, how long have you been Ant-Man again?
No, uh... It just sort of happened.
I wish I could fight bad guys like you!
I seem to mess it up almost every single time.
Maybe you just need someone watching your back.
Like a partner.
Dr. Pym. I actually heard what happened to you.
Ya'll went down to Quantum Realm. That's what this crazy, creepy Ghost was...
...who, like, walks through walls and stuff. It stole your tech.
And now it wants to take over the world, or whatever.
Who would believe that in your hour of need you would turn to us?
- Not me.
Because we robbed you. Do you remember?
That's us.
The only chance you've got...
...is both of you.
Ant-Man and the Wasp, teaming up.
- Follow my lead.
She seems...
...more intense.
- You go low, I go high.
I have wings. Why would I go low?
We're gonna die! I don't wanna die!
We didn't die!
What did I miss?
- We were just tiny!
I was partners with Hank on a project called "Goliath".
- How big did you get?
By record?
21 feet.
65 feet.
65?
If you two are finished comparing sizes...?
65.
