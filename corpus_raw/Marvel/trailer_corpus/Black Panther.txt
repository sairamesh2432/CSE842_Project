Tell me something.
What do you know about Wakanda?
It's a third-world country.
Textiles.
Shepherds.
Cool outfits.
All a front.
Explorers have searched for it.
Called it "El Dorado".
They looked for it in South America.
But it was in Africa the whole time.
I'm the only one...
...who's seen it...
...and made it out alive.
I can see you!
The world...
Is changing.
Soon...
...there will only be the conquered...
...and the conquerors.
You are a good man.
With a good heart.
And it's hard for a good man...
...to be...
...a king.
