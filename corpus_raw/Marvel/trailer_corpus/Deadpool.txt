I love you, Wade Wilson. We can fight this.
You're right, the cancer's only in my
liver, lungs, prostate and brain
All things I can live without
What if I told you, we can make you better?
You're a fighter, we can give you abilities...
...most men only dream of
Make you a superhero
You just promise, you'll do right by me
So, I can do right by someone else
And please don't make the super suit green...
...or animated!
One thing that never survives this process...
...is the sense of humor
Yeah we'll see about that, posh spice
Aww, come on, you're gonna leave me here with less angry Rosie O'Donald?
