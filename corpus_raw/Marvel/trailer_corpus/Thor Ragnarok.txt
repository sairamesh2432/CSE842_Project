So much has happened since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer, like, yesterday. So, that's still pretty fresh.
And then I went on a journey of self-discovery,
where I met you .
Where are we?
You have no idea!!!
Hela, the goddess of death, has invaded Asgard.
- Oh, I've missed this!
- And you and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No. I won, easily.
- Doesn't sound right.
- Well, it's true.
- Asgard is dead.
But it'll be reborn in my image.
I thought you'd be glad to see me.
- We need to stop her here and now, to prevent Ragnarok, the end of everything.
So I'm putting together a team.
Like the old days.
- Surprise!!! This'll be such fun.
- Hello!
- Hi.
- He's a fighter.
- Here we go!
- I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the goddess of death.
What were you the god of, again?
- We're the same, you and I, just a couple of hot-headed fools.
- Yes, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
- Kind of both like fire.
- But Hulk like raging fire.
- Thor like smoldering fire.
