Oh

glimpse into the past
[Music]
you've got to have to do for me what I
once did for you
[Music]
you'll need me as well
[Music]
side by side to end this war
before it ever begins so wake up Lion
body in them what find me
convince me all of this it's good to
take the turbos then where do I find you
but different paths that darker pass him
Melvin I was a very different man
leave me
[Music]
it
[Music]
patience isn't my strongest suit
I hope won't your suffering
but what your future
please we need you to hope again
[Applause]
