coming up on the drop zone cap you do
anything funny Saturday night well all
the guys in my barbershop quartet are
dead so no not really you know if you
ask Kristen out from Statistics you'd
probably say yes that's why don't ask
too shy or too scared too busy was he
wearing a parachute no no he wasn't
[Music]
join shield to protect people captain to
build a better world sometimes means
tearing the old one down that makes
enemies
are you ready for the world to see you
as you really are
look out the window you know how the
game works
disorder war
all it takes is one step
we will neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen
I thought the punishment usually came
after the crime shield takes the world
as it is not as we'd like it to be this
isn't freedom this is fear
you need to keep both eyes open before
we get started does anyone want to get
out
your work has been a gift to mankind
you've shaped the century
I need you to do it one more time
you uh it's time
you
