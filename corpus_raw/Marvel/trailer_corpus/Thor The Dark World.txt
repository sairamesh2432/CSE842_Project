after all this time now you come to
visit me brother why
[Music]
- mock I need your help I wish I could
trust you
if you did you'd be the fool I always
took you for
some believe that before the universe
there was nothing there wrong there was
darkness and it has survived
I gave you my word I would return for
you
[Music]
face an enemy run into a few known only
to one you must be truly desperate to
come to me how if we do nothing they
will destroy us
you even think about betraying him I'll
kill you
that was for New York
your bravery will not ease your pain
you family
we'll be extinguished
we're running out of time
the very fabric of reality can be torn
apart
find a way to save us all
Oh yours
anyone else
