TONY STARK: It seems like a thousand
years ago...
I fought my way out of that cave...
became Iron Man...
realized I loved you...
I know I said no more surprises, but...
I was really hoping to pull off one last one.
PEGGY CARTER: The world has changed.
None of us can go back...
All we can do is our best...
and sometimes the best that we can do...
is to start over.

STEVE ROGERS: I keep telling everybody

but not us.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there's a...
small chance...
we owe this...
to everyone who's not in this room
to try.
We will.
