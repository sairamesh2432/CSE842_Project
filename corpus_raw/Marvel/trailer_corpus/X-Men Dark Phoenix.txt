Why did you make me do that?
Look at me focus on my voice. I'm not giving up on you Jean. She was my friend
You're my family James no matter what
Stop stop stop
Look
You're special gene
and if you stop fighting that force inside you
(soundtrack music)
To embrace it
(explosion)
He will possess the very power of a God
(strange background sound)
she will kill us all
Tell me how we fix this trough tell me what to do now don't know what to do
No, they don't understand they fear and what they fear we seek to destroy
It's your fault Charles tries to protect our I'm scared
When I lose control bad things happen to people I punch
The girl dies. She's still June we can still help her
Sometimes you want to believe people are something that they are not well it'll mean Venus who they are
It's too late
She's coming
