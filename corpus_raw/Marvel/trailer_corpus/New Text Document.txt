your life general Hammond has said that
wars are fought with weapons but they
are won by man

greatest army in history I should be
going with you
look I know you don't think I can do
this it's in the back alleys Stevens boy
every army begins with one man five
tries in five different cities I can
offer you a chance he will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier
because the Beekman Joseph any
Australian was a valuable that wasn't so

or in off if we get into
your task won't be simple
who the hell are the [ __ ] up money
your enemy is not what you expect
