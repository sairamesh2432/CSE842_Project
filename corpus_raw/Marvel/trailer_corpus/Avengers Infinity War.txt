There was an idea.
To bring together...
A group of remarkable people.
To see if we could become...
Something more.
So when they needed us...
...we could fight the battles...
...that they never could.
In time...
You will know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately that you're right...
...yet to fail...
...all the same.
Dread it.
Run from it.
Destiny still arrives.
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.
And get this man a shield.
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe.
But this...
Does put a smile on my face.
Who the hell are you guys?
