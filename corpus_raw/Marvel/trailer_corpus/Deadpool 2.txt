We gettin' close!
DEADPOOL: You all know the drill!
Intercept the convoy.
And watch out for Cable!
Hit it!
There's this kid, he's in trouble...
Move or die.
DEADPOOL: Pump the hate brakes, Thanos.
I ain't lettin' Cable get to him,
but I can't do this alone.
We need backup.
We're gonna form a super-duper fucking group.
It's time to get back on LinkedIn.
Meet Bedlam.
My name's Shatterstar.
Domino.
-I'm lucky. -(COCKS GUN AND FIRES)
DEADPOOL: Luck isn't a superpower.
And certainly not very cinematic.
-Yes, it is. -DEADPOOL: Let's meet
in the middle and say "No, it isn't."
Fuck it. It's showtime.
Whoo!
CABLE: You're no fucking hero.
You're just a clown,
dressed up as a sex toy.
So dark.
You sure you're not from the DC Universe?
DEADPOOL: Bring it on, One-Eyed Willie.
Your bullets, they're really fast!
Last but not least...
Peter.
DEADPOOL: Any power you wanna tell us about?
I don't... I don't have one.
Um, I just saw the ad.
DEADPOOL: You're in.
