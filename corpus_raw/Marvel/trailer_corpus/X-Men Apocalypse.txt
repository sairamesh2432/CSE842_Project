I saw the end of the world
i could feel all this death
Jean .. it was just a dream

I have been called many things over many lifetimes
(Trying to hide)
RAH .. KRISHNA .. YAHWEW
every since the world found out about mutants there have been secret socites .. who see them in some kind of second coming or sign of god

.. mutant
you are all my children
and you are lost ..
.. because you follow blind leaders
but i am here now
i'm here .. for you
wherever this being was, he always have four followers, he would imbue with power
like the four horsemen of the apocalypse .. he got that one from the bible
or the bible got it from him

ohh god

the world needs the x-men
that is why i am here ..
.. to fight
not all of us can controll our powers
then don't ..
.. this is war
everything they built ..
.. will fall
and from the ashes of their world ..
.. we will build a better one
i've never felt power like this before
