war is a universal language I know
renegade soldier when I see one
never occurred to me that one might come
from above
space invasion
mccartey
truth be told I was ready to hang it up
to let miss you today so you're not for
her on here it's hard to explain
I keep having these memories
I see flashes
[Music]
I think I had a life here
[Music]
but I can't tell if it's real
we have no idea what threats are out
there
we can't do this alone
I'm not what you think I am
you
