I'm gonna show you something beautfiul
Everyone screaming...
For mercy
You want to protect the world
But you don't want it to change
You're all puppets
Tangled in...
Strings
Strings
♫" I've got no strings, to hold me down" ♫
♫ "To make me fret..." ♫
♫ "Or make me frown" ♫
♫ "I had strings, but now I'm free" ♫
It's the end
The end of the path I started us on
Nothing lasts forever
♫ "I had strings, but now I'm free" ♫
There are...
No strings on me
