1
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,781
<i>We get the wheels,
we get la feria,</i>

2
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,812
<i>we keep moving on.
No messing around.</i>

3
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,039
<i>You mess those wheels up
this time, Chong,</i>

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>I'm gonna have your ass.</i>

5
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>Move!</i>

6
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,016
<i>- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.</i>

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,295
<i>Where's your party, boy?</i>

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,787
<i>Turn down the radio.</i>

9
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,346
You inviting the cops, too,
or what?

10
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,498
<i>I want El Cromo.</i>

11
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,585
Gonna get some green

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,162
for this shit right here, homes.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,831
Fuck.

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,168
Hey.

15
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,439
Uh, guys?

16
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,109
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,392
Look at this guy, eh?

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,113
The plating flakes off.

19
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,367
Yeah?

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,326
This is a lease. No one's
gonna pay to ride...

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,500
Shit.

22
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,131
Come on, man.

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,187
Uh, guys. 'Guys-

24
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,518
MAN 1; What the fuck?

25
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,225
Guys, seriously,
you don't wanna do this.

26
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,230
Take him out.

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,078
MAN 1; Fuck him up!

28
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,589
No! Not the car!

29
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,715
Get that puto!

30
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,092
Fuck him up, man!

31
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,549
Fuck him up!

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,432
Get him!

33
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,892
Hit that fool!

34
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,019
Motherfucker!

35
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,638
Shit.

36
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,869
Fuck.

37
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,296
<i>Everyone's asleep, Burt.</i>

38
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,218
<i>Sleepwalking.
Between the ice caps,</i>

39
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,672
<i>the pornographers,
poisoned water, mutants...</i>

40
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,306
<i>ifs all connected.</i>

41
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,804
<i>Hey, Clyde. ITS 2029.</i>

42
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,520
<i>Why are we still
talking about mutants?</i>

43
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,061
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

44
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,567
Yeah, it was a good trip.

45
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,236
Killed it up and down the fence.

46
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,897
USA! USA! USA!

47
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,658
USA! USA! USA! USA!

48
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,274
Wolverine.

49
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,227
I knew it was you.

50
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,730
Oh, fuck.
Please!

51
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,568
I'm in trouble!

52
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,943
You're the only one
that could help!

53
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,704
Get the fuck away from me!

54
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,956
Please!

55
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,213
Logan!

56
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,459
Who was that?

57
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,470
I don't know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry.

58
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,575
As I live and breathe,
the Wolverine.

59
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,869
And he's a junkie now.

60
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,499
Who the fuck are you?

61
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,162
You know, you got some
buckshot in your door.

62
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,038
I heard you was in Phoenix.

63
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,049
But then, last night,
some friends of mine

64
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,296
in Texas HP called...

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,711
and told me they found

66
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,013
three dead cholos
in a pullout on 54.

67
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,300
Not unusual, I know.

68
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,969
Except one was missing a
hand, another one a leg.

69
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,555
So they was thinking...

70
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,725
it was either an escaped
tiger or Freddy Krueger.

71
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,315
But neither one of them
can drive...

72
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,481
one being fictional,
the other one extinct.

73
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,820
And since the wheel lugs
they found

74
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,822
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

75
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,991
and, well...

76
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,581
this is a '24 Chrysler.

77
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,501
She found you yet?

78
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,832
Gabriela?

79
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,085
See...

80
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,751
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

81
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,340
Well, not really.
I'm looking for someone

82
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,763
who's looking for you.

83
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,762
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

84
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,769
Something for which
lam responsible.

85
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,515
Mexican lady.

86
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,392
Has her sights on you now.

87
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,237
Doesn't ring any bells?

88
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,488
I don't know any Gabriela,

89
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,941
so get the fuck out of my car.

90
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,734
Oh.

91
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,823
You know...

92
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,780
I know
what you're hiding, amigo.

93
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,038
The old cue ball
south of the border.

94
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,956
What do you want?

95
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,712
A little co-operation.

96
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,636
I'm a fan, by the way.

97
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,349
Fuck, fuck!

98
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,816
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

99
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,985
I know I said June,
but I need the boat now.

100
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,650
Why would that mean
the price go up'?

101
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,910
Listen to me.

102
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,912
I know you wanted 70...

103
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,381
Okay, what if I could
put together

104
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,407
$45,000 cash right now?

105
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,167
Hello? Hello?

106
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,452
Shit.

107
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,915
Hey, Sam.

108
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,083
Morning.

109
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,520
<i>Mucus</i>

110
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,385
"I know that virtue
to be in you, Brutus."

111
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,055
"As well as I do know
your outward favor."

112
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,519
"Well, honor is the subject
of my story."

113
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,150
He's having a bad day.

114
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,685
They're all bad days.

115
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,695
He needed these six hours ago.

116
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,738
This is not enough, you know.

117
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,196
Won't see us through the week.

118
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,534
I'm working on it.

119
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,867
Your turn.

120
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,169
I've had a rough night.

121
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,871
Poor you.

122
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,341
In other news'
he told me last night

123
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,700
he's communicating with someone.

124
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,761
He's not talking to anybody.

125
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,220
Don't be so sure.

126
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,385
He's got all these details.

127
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,101
<i>I thought that tank was
supposed to act as a barrier.</i>

128
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,435
It's got them cracks in it.

129
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,770
Just please stop.

130
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,434
Bottom left.

131
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,529
You're not listening.

132
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,946
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

133
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,785
I think he's trying to
read my mind.

134
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,244
That's what these are for.

135
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,457
<i>Eating his curds and whey</i>

136
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,294
<i>Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her</i>

137
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,616
<i>And frightened Miss Muffet...</i>

138
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,265
Friends, I have
good news for you today!

139
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,808
It's not about what you do.

140
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,976
It's not about your deeds.

141
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,562
You can't
live up to God's rules.

142
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,733
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

143
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,494
Make way, sir.

144
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,829
I said make way!

145
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,117
The new Quesalupa
from Taco Bell!

146
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,627
Get it with chicken!
Get it with steak!

147
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,834
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

148
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,794
it's the next big thing!

149
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,959
Go now while supplies last.

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,837
Who are you?

151
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,589
You know who I am.

152
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,099
You're the man
who puts me to sleep.

153
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,475
We both could use some sleep.

154
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,011
No! No!

155
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,650
What are you doing to me?

156
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,726
Charles.

157
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
Come on, now.

158
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,365
How long have I been here?

159
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,091
What are these?

160
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,565
You remember what they are.

161
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,512
The shots mellow the seizures.

162
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,264
The pills
keep them from happening.

163
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,430
How about you blow on them
to make them safe?

164
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,723
Fuck off, Logan.

165
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,392
So you remember who I am now.

166
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,902
I always know who you are.

167
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,564
It's just sometimes
I don't recognize you.

168
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,903
Take the pills.

169
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,457
You leave me alone
with that fucking albino.

170
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,118
He doesn't listen to me.

171
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,416
I know a damn speciation
when I see one.

172
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,580
A what?

173
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,796
Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.

174
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,770
There are forces
trying to kill them.

175
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,637
Forces?
They want help.

176
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,299
Forces, forces.

177
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,809
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

178
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,595
They don't want me,
they want you.

179
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,151
Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.

180
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,154
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

181
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,566
The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,

182
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,992
Charles, a longtime.

183
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,161
There are no new mutants.
Understand?

184
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,494
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

185
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,125
You always thought...

186
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,953
we were part of God's plan.

187
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,833
But maybe...

188
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,511
Maybe we were God's mistake.

189
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,108
What a disappointment you are.

190
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,152
When I found you...

191
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,157
<i>you were pursuing a career
as a cage fighter.</i>

192
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,528
A warm capper to a life
as an assassin.

193
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,947
Hooked on barbiturates.

194
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,366
You were an animal.

195
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,035
But we took you in.

196
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,830
I gave you a family.

197
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,290
And they're gone now.

198
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,374
Logan.

199
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,877
Logan...

200
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,547
What did you do?

201
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,226
What did you do?

202
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,478
Answer me!
Why are we here?

203
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,388
No one should live like this.

204
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,977
Drugged in a fucking tank!

205
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,232
It's for your own good.

206
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,396
No, it's not!

207
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,073
You're waiting for me to die.

208
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,675
I don't wanna fight...

209
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,508
but there's things
we need to discuss.

210
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,930
What things?

211
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,969
Well, would it be
considered nagging...

212
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,771
if I was to repeat
my previous observation...

213
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,523
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

214
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,269
It's what the guy gave me.

215
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,689
Wasn't in a position
to make demands.

216
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,277
I almost died this morning.

217
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,001
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.

218
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,169
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

219
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,536
You're less affected.

220
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,538
You know he needs a higher dose.

221
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,496
And I know you got more
money sq squirreled away.

222
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,927
That money's
to get us out of here.

223
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,703
No, not us.
You and him.

224
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,497
You're saving
to buy a Sunseeker.

225
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,006
"Sun" is the keyword.

226
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,385
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

227
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,544
Do you?

228
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,466
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

229
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,842
Found this in your pocket.

230
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,894
Adamantium.

231
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,328
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

232
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,163
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

233
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,439
I just mopped these floors.

234
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,906
I don't need this shit.

235
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,999
A year ago, you asked
me to help you.

236
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,922
And God knows I've tried.

237
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,710
But I can't help you,
Logan, not really...

238
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,387
if you're not
going to talk to me.

239
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,053
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.

240
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,889
You don't wanna talk about that.

241
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,763
Or the booze you're drinking.

242
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,853
Or the pus you're wiping
away from your knuckles.

243
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,936
Or the blood
I wash from your clothes.

244
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,442
Or the fresh wounds
in your chest.

245
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,945
The ones that aren't healing.

246
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,533
And I'm pretty sure...

247
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,711
you don't wanna talk
about the fact

248
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,612
that you can't read
the label on that bottle.

249
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,532
It says, "Ibuprofen."

250
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,789
That was my favorite mug.

251
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,128
Stay out of my shit.

252
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,757
Somethings happening
to you, Logan.

253
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,510
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.

254
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,556
<i>Best night ever!</i>

255
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,979
Hey, driver.

256
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,584
I love you.
I love you.

257
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,416
You're such a doll.

258
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,727
Mr. Logan.

259
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:44,933
Oh, Jesus.

260
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,685
Please. We need a ride.

261
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,724
Not available.
Call a cab.

262
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,931
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

263
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,161
I don't wanna
know your name, lady.

264
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,653
There are men after us.

265
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,289
We need to get out of here.

266
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,031
Go north, cross to Canada.

267
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,737
Anyone can do that job.

268
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,901
I'll give you $50,000.

269
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,154
How did you find me, huh?

270
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,864
'Cause you are fucking up
my life, lady!

271
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,249
The people after you,
they're on my ass now!

272
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,535
Sightings were posted.

273
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,748
Laura, go inside.

274
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,086
What sightings?

275
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,973
People said someone who
looked like the Wolverine

276
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,999
was in El Paso, driving.

277
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,759
Said he looked old.

278
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,968
Hey!

279
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,095
I told you
to stop it with that ball!

280
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,384
Bad girl!
No, please.

281
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,098
I told you, bad girl!
No, please.

282
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,363
Mamacita's gonna
have to pay for that.

283
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,388
Stop, please. No.

284
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,766
Shit!

285
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,582
They're gonna
have to pay for damages.

286
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,406
And she has cash.

287
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,566
I've seen it.

288
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,418
You should get your fat ass
back in your office.

289
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,443
You'll get your money.

290
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,365
Don't let her call anyone,
please.

291
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,580
They will find us.
They will kill us.

292
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,131
I am a nurse.

293
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,798
Was. In Mexico City.

294
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,425
When did that happen?

295
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,978
This morning.
Near the border.

296
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,983
I got away from them, but...

297
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,312
now they know my car.

298
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,405
Look, I gotta go.

299
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,787
No, wait. Please. Here.

300
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,329
Please, wait! Look.

301
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,241
Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.

302
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,585
Here. Take us
to this address.

303
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,172
You can have $30,000 more
when we get there.

304
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,626
My friends there
will give it to you.

305
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,594
They will be waiting.

306
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,013
They will give you anything.

307
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,303
Where did you get this?

308
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,809
My boyfriend.

309
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,309
He wants to kill me
and take her.

310
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,021
And that's your daughter?

311
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,020
Yes.

312
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,159
I know you're still good inside.

313
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,398
I know you want to help us.

314
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,504
You don't know
anything about me.

315
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,529
Please!

316
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,867
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

317
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,956
I can't just leave
to North Dakota!

318
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,620
We have to be there Friday.
Or what?

319
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,381
Or we miss our chance to cross.

320
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,004
Please.

321
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,214
You have to. Please.

322
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,805
Please.

323
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,065
I like those.
Huh?

324
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,942
They make you look younger.

325
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,740
Charles, listen.

326
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,405
I gotta go away
for a few days, okay?

327
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,404
I got a long ride
for some good money...

328
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,450
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

329
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,541
We're gonna
drive down to Yelapa.

330
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,896
We're gonna
get ourselves a boat.

331
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,912
And we're gonna
go live on the ocean.

332
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,080
Will you be safe there?

333
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,551
Yeah. We'll be safe.

334
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,303
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

335
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,935
Be back in a few days.

336
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,263
Shit.

337
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,005
Logan.
Yeah?

338
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,343
What happened?

339
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,883
Did something go wrong?

340
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,517
The job was wrong to begin with.

341
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,030
Logan!

342
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,493
Logan!

343
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,707
What?

344
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,877
Who does this belong to?

345
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,551
Who's that?

346
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,054
Thought you were supposed to
see shit coming.

347
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,392
I can track mutants.

348
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,557
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

349
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,396
Go inside
and keep Charles quiet.

350
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,860
Go inside now!

351
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,988
You need to turn around,
asshole.

352
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,072
This is private property.

353
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,456
Yes, it is.

354
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,910
In fact, I believe it belongs

355
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,581
to a multinational
smelting company...

356
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,121
based in Shanghai.

357
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,966
Where are you keeping
the old man? Hmm?

358
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,593
Is he over there?

359
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,426
Or is he there?

360
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,591
That'd be smart.

361
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,390
I'd like to meet him.

362
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,181
I'm told the HSA
classifies his brain

363
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,312
as a weapon
of mass destruction now.

364
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,269
Damn shame,
what happened back east.

365
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,775
He's been dead for a year.

366
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,071
I need the girl.

367
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,280
What girl?

368
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,563
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

369
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,617
There's no girl here.

370
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,453
I know you went to the motel.

371
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,833
Yeah, I was called there.

372
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,915
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.

373
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,580
Just the woman.
Such as she was.

374
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,926
So, you saw Gabriela.

375
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,506
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

376
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,732
You didn't shoot
the poor thing, did you?

377
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,926
No, did you?

378
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,144
I asked you first.

379
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,395
I don't like guns.

380
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,638
Of course.

381
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,184
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

382
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,523
Like I asked.

383
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,819
See?

384
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,029
You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.

385
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,956
Logan. Logan!

386
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,120
This is Laura.

387
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,830
Caliban, come!

388
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,800
This is who
I've been telling you about.

389
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,677
This is Laura.

390
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,213
We've been waiting for you.

391
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,302
Come, come here.

392
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,855
It's okay.

393
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,348
Come.

394
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,066
Laura.

395
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,697
It's okay. It's okay.

396
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,817
Come.

397
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,068
Come.

398
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,325
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

399
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,825
It's safe.

400
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,577
We can look after you here.

401
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,203
Come on.

402
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,250
Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?

403
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,417
Worse.

404
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,882
Is he by himself?

405
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,091
Yeah, not for long.

406
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,348
You get him back in his ride,

407
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,050
take him out to the wash
and dump him.

408
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,889
What if he wakes up
before I get there?

409
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,184
Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.

410
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,906
Yes.

411
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,078
Logan.

412
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,414
Logan.
Hey. Hey!

413
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,042
You'll get it back
after I figure out

414
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,765
what you and your mother
have got us into.

415
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,135
No, Logan.
What?

416
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,296
I think the...

417
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,357
Logan, the woman that you
met, that's not her mother.

418
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,645
So she talks'?
We're communicating.

419
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,063
Communicating.

420
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,899
Take these now.

421
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,490
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

422
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,812
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

423
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,119
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

424
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,036
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.

425
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,295
Yes, she is!

426
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,546
What's her gift, Charles?

427
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,173
Eating? Pipe throwing?

428
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,302
It's okay.

429
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,823
Oh, yeah.

430
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,905
Take the gun.
Dump the body.

431
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,162
Text me when you're
on the way back.

432
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,600
You have anything else you need?

433
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,328
Food for the kid?

434
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,206
You're fucked now, mutie.

435
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,725
It's okay.

436
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,684
- Choc-choc.
- It's not a choo-choo.

437
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,357
It's okay. Sit down.

438
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,862
We gotta go.
What?

439
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,567
What's going on? Where'?
Stay here.

440
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,198
Don't move.
Where are we going?

441
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,736
Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.

442
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,618
Logan, the girl. You've got
to go back for the girl.

443
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,050
Logan, what about the girl?

444
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,882
Logan.

445
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,599
Logan, we mustn't forget
about Laura.

446
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,104
She's not our problem.

447
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,689
Shit!

448
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,157
Ah, shit!

449
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:41,986
Logan.

450
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,271
Yeah, I'm thinking.

451
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,485
The child.

452
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,946
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

453
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,280
Please be quiet.
Logan.

454
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,536
Huh.

455
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,458
Charles Xavier.
Where's Caliban?

456
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,960
America's most wanted
octogenarian.

457
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,621
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

458
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,628
Ah.

459
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,548
Where's Caliban?

460
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,194
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

461
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,141
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

462
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,805
Hold you, she's not here.

463
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,225
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

464
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,661
Well, I left him
in the same ditch

465
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,811
he was gonna leave me in.

466
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,374
Jesus, Wolverine,

467
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,497
seeing you like this
just breaks my damn heart.

468
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,624
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

469
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:53,842
Go get her.

470
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,082
Laura.

471
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,964
That a girl!

472
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,424
Hey, Dab'!-

473
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,019
Laura.“

474
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,026
Laura!

475
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,192
Honey, you wanna stay
where you are.

476
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,286
You wanna see
your friends, right?

477
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,164
Command, stop.

478
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,658
You said alive or dead.

479
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:43,952
Laura!

480
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,621
Laura.

481
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,374
Laura.

482
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,293
No. No.

483
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,554
Move! Go!

484
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,501
Move! Go!

485
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,480
Stop shooting!

486
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,737
She heals! Move! Go!

487
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,857
Holy shit!

488
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,527
Gotcha!

489
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,246
Ah!

490
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:11,964
Come on, hold her down.

491
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,641
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

492
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,142
Hold on!

493
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,518
Very much like you.

494
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,839
Laura, are you all right?

495
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,644
Ahh!

496
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,810
Move!

497
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,737
Hold on!

498
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,374
Fuck! Come on!

499
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:15,997
Come on!

500
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,172
Shit.

501
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,484
Fall in! Let's go!

502
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,613
Oh, watch out!

503
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:27,944
Ah!

504
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,787
Sit back.

505
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,541
Bring me the tracker.

506
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,053
You.

507
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,306
Who the hell are you?

508
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,644
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

509
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,480
You know who she is, Logan.

510
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,357
No, I don't.

511
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,738
Does she remind you of anybody?

512
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,564
I read about you
when I was a kid.

513
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,101
I believe you're thinking
of someone else.

514
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,185
Hmm.

515
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,697
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you
used to work for my team.

516
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,916
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

517
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,119
What changed?

518
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,545
You got religion?

519
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,260
I'm gonna need you to do

520
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,095
one more thing
for the good guys...

521
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,392
and track one more
special mute for me.

522
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,772
I'm not helping you.

523
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,933
Of course, you'd say that.

524
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,479
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

525
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,408
Beware of the light.

526
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,196
Caliban, I bet that's what
your mama told you

527
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,906
every day when you was a kid.

528
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,459
Beware of the light.

529
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,088
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

530
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,765
The girl is not worth it,
trust me.

531
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,260
She's not a natural fuck-up
like you.

532
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,100
She's a business mistake,
a R&D gone bad.

533
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,434
There's liability.

534
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,231
They can't have things
with patents

535
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,105
running around,
hurting people, can they?

536
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,020
We need to get her off the board

537
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,776
before she hurts anybody else.

538
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,532
Someone you care about, maybe.

539
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,458
So, get to sniffin'.

540
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,956
<i>My name is Gabriela Lopez.</i>

541
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,632
<i>1 am a nurse.</i>

542
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,418
<i>And for 10 years, I worked for</i>

543
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,970
<i>Transigen Research
in Mexico City.</i>

544
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,846
<i>Transigen is owned
by an American company.</i>

545
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,689
<i>What I am about to show you
is illegal...</i>

00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,312
<i>in the US. And Canada.</i>

547
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,068
<i>They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.</i>

548
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,244
<i>But, of Course, that was a lie.</i>

549
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,657
<i>These children
were born in Transigen.</i>

550
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,201
<i>They were born here...</i>

551
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,746
<i>and have never left.</i>

552
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,506
<i>They have never seen
the sun or the ocean...</i>

553
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,834
<i>rain or snow...</i>

554
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,886
<i>or any of God's creatures.</i>

555
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,714
<i>They have no
birth certificates.“...</i>

556
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,683
<i>no names...</i>

557
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,182
<i>Besides the ones
we have given them.</i>

558
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:10,193
<i>They were raised in the
bellies of Mexican girls.</i>

559
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,228
<i>Girls no one can find anymore.</i>

560
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:16,191
<i>Their fathers are
semillas geneticas...</i>

561
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,859
<i>special seeds in homes.</i>

562
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,920
- Birthday? No birth.
- Maria.

<i>We do not dress them up
for Halloween.</i>

564
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,927
<i>We do not cal! Them "baby"
or kiss boo-boos.</i>

565
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,900
<i>Don't think of them as children.</i>

566
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,016
<i>Think of them as things”.</i>

567
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,594

568
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>Comprende?</i>

569
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,804
<i>Si, senor.</i>

570
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,182
<i>They thought we were too poor</i>

571
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,482
<i>and stupid to understand.</i>

572
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,065
We're poor, yes...

573
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,274
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

574
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,567
Use your powers.

575
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,163
<i>This is business.</i>

576
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,791
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

577
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,409
<i>Killers.</i>

578
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,460
These are babies of mutantes...

579
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,259
North Dakota.

580
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,427
Mmm.

581
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,770
You took that woman's money.

582
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,307
You said you would take
the child there.

583
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,239
What is she?

584
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,280
She's your daughter, Logan.

585
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,162
Alkali has your genetic code.

586
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,493
Not just mine.

587
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,614
Logan...

588
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,759
I don't want to talk about it.

589
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:49,968
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore.

590
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,414
Logan...
Just stop.

591
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,249
I have to pee.

592
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,468
Last ride.

593
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,023
You're welcome.

594
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,885
Slop it.
For God's sake,

595
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,283
I can do this myself!

596
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,585
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

597
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,735
Just get on with it.

598
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,366
Not with you standing there.

599
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,122

Hello.

602
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,817
Hi, there!

603
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,837
You know you gotta pay
for that, right?

604
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,412
Hey! Where's your
mommy and daddy, huh?

605
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,828
Come on.

606
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,087
That's enough. These, too.

607
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,420
Shit!

608
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,716
Not okay!

609
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,051
Sorry.

610
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,804
Urn, do you sell phone chargers?

611
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,509
Uh...

612
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,232
Come on. Get in the car.

613
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,715
<i>As the children became older...</i>

614
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,926
<i>Laura. Laura.</i>

615
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,265
<i>.. . they became
more difficult.</i>

616
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,391
<i>They could not be controlled.</i>

617
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,105
<i>The company made their bodies
into weapons.</i>

618
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,937
<i>Tried to teach them to kill.</i>

619
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,322
<i>But they did not want to fight.</i>

620
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,907
<i>A soldier who will not fight
is useless.</i>

621
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,956
<i>Inside this building...</i>

622
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,435
<i>they are working on
something new.</i>

623
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,121
<i>Something they think
is better than the children.</i>

624
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,127
<i>Something they say
is without a smut.</i>

625
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,809
<i>Would you like to hear
my fun' fab report, Dr. Rice?</i>

626
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,506
<i>You can't get good sushi here.</i>

627
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,800
<i>It's the Mexican equivalent
of Denver, Colorado.</i>

628
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,731
<i>They must have been successful.</i>

629
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,978
<i>About a week ago, they told
us to shut our program down.</i>

630
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,316
<i>They started putting
the children to sleep.</i>

631
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,657
<i>We are going to save
as many children as we can.</i>

632
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,076

633
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,282
<i>A place for mutants.</i>

634
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,661
<i>They call it Eden.</i>

00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,296
<i>If you are watching this”.</i>

636
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,305
<i>It means that I am dead.</i>

637
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,636
<i>I am no! Sure if
any other children survived.</i>

638
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,146
<i>We were separated.</i>

639
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,353
<i>There is no more money.</i>

640
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,188
<i>That was a lie.</i>

641
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,236
<i>She's not my child.</i>

642
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,152
<i>But I love her.</i>

00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,701
<i>You may not love hen.</i>

644
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,698
<i>But she is your child.</i>

645
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,414
<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

646
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,878
<i>take her to safety.</i>

647
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,136
Is this where we're hiding out?

648
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,915
We're not hiding out.

649
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,094
We're gonna get
a couple of hours' sleep...

650
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,849
clean up, get some new clothes,

651
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,098
get a new ride
and get outta here.

00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:54,569
Let's go.

661
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,774
We need clothes.

662
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,712
Going up.

663
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,834
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

664
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,132
Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.

666
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,177
Push up again.
Thank you.

667
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,386
Going up.

668
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,677
Come here. Stand there.
Just stand there.

669
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,767
Logan, it's yours.

670
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:26,893
What?

671
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,054
I'm not gonna wear it now.

672
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,820
In the room. We'll get
changed in the room.

00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,659
This is a very
famous picture, Laura.

676
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,543
It's almost 100 years old.

677
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:13,402
<i>In fire, in death, oh, Lord</i>

678
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,282
<i>Abide with me</i>

679
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,329
I first saw this picture

680
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,907
at the Essoldo Cinema
in my hometown...

681
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,247

00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,262
Shit.

685
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,223
<i>I've heard

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,437
<i>Prove it.</i>

688
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,160
You read these
in your spare time?

689
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,868
<i>Oh, yeah, Charles, we got
ourselves an X-Men fan.</i>

690
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,541
You do know
they're all bullshit, right?

691
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,587
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

692
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,831
In the real world, people die.

693
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,840
And no self-promoting asshole

694
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,418

This is ice cream for bed-wetters.

696
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,147
Her nurse has been feeding
her some grade-A bullshit.

697
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,548
I don't think
Laura needs reminding

698
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,053
of life's impermanence.

699
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,894
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

700
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,018
Two more pills in one hour.

701
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,058
Give 'em to him.

702
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,935
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

703
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,275
<i>A man has to be
what he is, Joey.</i>

704
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,320
<i>Can't break the mold.</i>

705
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,827
<i>I tried it
and it didn't work for me.</i>

706
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,329
<i>Joey, there's no living
with a killing.</i>

707
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,411
<i>There's no going back from one.</i>

708
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,826
<i>Right or wrong, it's a brand.</i>

709
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,502
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

710
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,000
<i>Now you run on home
to your mother,</i>

711
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,798
<i>and tell her
everything's all right.</i>

712
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,053
<i>And there aren't any more
guns in the valley.</i>

713
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,948
Who are you guys?

714
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,735
More cops? 'Cause I told

715
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,320
the other guys
everything that I...

716
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,590
Get up!
In your cage, tracker.

717
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,421
You did your job.

718
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,482
Fellas.

719
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,292
Shit.

720
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,174
Knock yourselves out.

721
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,645
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand...

722
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,922
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

723
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,728
mounted, balanced,
and complete paperwork.

724
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,057
I'll give you 10 as-is,

725
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,601
if you can forget the paperwork.

726
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,647
Well, you still need new
tires, man, they're bald.

727
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,931
How long will that take?

728
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,099
An hour.

729
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,716
Jesus.

730
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,240
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

731
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,582
Sir, are the keys in...
Sir!

732
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,746
You have
the keys in it? Sir!

733
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,836
Shit!

734
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,028
Charles. Charles!

735
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,497
Argh!

736
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,017
Going up.

737
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,079
Oh, shit!

738
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,459
You all right?

739
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:53,663
We gotta get outta here.

740
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,585
I'm so sorry.

741
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,630
I'm so sorry.

742
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,008
<i>Emergency
personnel are still on scene</i>

743
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,660
<i>at Harrah's Casino Hate!
In Oklahoma City...</i>

744
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,749
<i>where at least 400 guests
were stricken</i>

745
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,671
<i>with temporary paralysis
yesterday.</i>

746
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,624
<i>Many are noting a similarity</i>

747
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,507
<i>to the Westchester incident
over a year ago...</i>

748
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,257
<i>that left over 600 injured...</i>

749
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,688
<i>and took me lives
of seven mutants,</i>

750
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,180
<i>including several
of the X-Men.</i>

751
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,049
Knock it off.

752
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,429
I said, knock ii off!

753
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,188
She's a child, Logan.

754
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,184
And, point of fact,
she's your...

755
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,151
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

756
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,374
Tell me, how long has it been?

757
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,741
I don't know!

758
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,743
Two days.

759
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,448
You saw what happened yesterday.

760
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:07,630
If that shit
had gone on any longer,

761
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:08,746
everyone in that casino...

762
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,075
I did what I had to do
to save Laura.

763
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,538
You didn't do anything.

764
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,123
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

765
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:19,166
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

766
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,126
rambling on like a lunatic.

767
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,794
So much easier for you.

768
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,053
Easier? Jesus!

769
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,431
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

770
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,058
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

771
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,720
blaming someone else
for your boring shit.

772
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,646
I know, Pop, I'm such
a giant disappointment.

773
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:37,734
You honestly derive
no sense of purpose...

774
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,939
from what we're doing?

775
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,649
Okay, what are we doing?
Hmm?

776
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,946
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

777
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,155
Yeah, I see that.

778
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,536
And where we're taking her,
there are others.

779
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,493
Does that mean nothing to you?

780
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,498
Yeah, means nothing to me.

781
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,243
Especially since
Nurse Gabriela...

782
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,832
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

783
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,668
What are you talking about?

784
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,950
Give those to him, will you?

785
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,225
Take out two pills
and give them to him.

786
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,751
Logan! Logan!
Give 'em to him.

787
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,085
Now!

788
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,054
I wanna see it.

789
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,038
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...

790
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,655
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

791
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,114
Language, Logan.

792
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,401
And you're screaming
at a machine.

793
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,319
Oh, what? She can gut a man
with her feet,

794
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,922
she can't hear
a few naughty words, huh?

795
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,540
She can learn to be better.

796
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,166
You mean, better than me'?

797
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,043
Actually, yes.

798
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,960
And, by the way,
Laura's foot claws...

799
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,716
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

800
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,092
Is that a fact?

801
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,175
In a pride of lions,
the female...

802
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,806
is both hunter and caregiver.

803
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,057
Good to know.

804
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,927
She uses her front claws
for hunting...

805
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,437
and the back claws defensively.

806
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,513
Oh, yeah?

807
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,223
Thus, ensuring their survival.

808
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,647
Hey, hey!

809
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,140
We should help them.

810
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:21,852
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

811
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,688
Someone has come along.

812
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,747
Alert. Alert.

813
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,788
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

814
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,371
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

815
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,666
Ready? Go!

816
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,586
Ah. Good, got it.

817
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,424
Come on, let's get home. Laura!

818
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,005
Thank you so much for your help.

819
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,556
I'm Kathryn.
James.

820
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,715
This is my son, Nate.

821
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,099
Hi.
Hey.

822
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,680
That's your daughter?

823
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,016
Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...

824
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:44,935
Chuck.

825
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:46,056
Come on, Laura, let's go.

826
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,022
Well, can we show
our appreciation

827
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,745
and treat the three of you
to a decent meal?

828
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,066
We don't live far from here.

829
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,277
Uh, no, thanks.
That would be lovely!

830
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,953
My name is Dr. Rice.

831
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,959
But you can call me Zander
if you like.

832
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,624
My colleague tells me

833
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,082
you've been somewhat resistant.

834
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,213
He believes you've been

835
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,043
dispensing
delayed information...

836
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,304
to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

837
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,943
I'm offering you the possibility

838
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,264
of redemption, Caliban.

839
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,229
To protect the world,
and in the process,

840
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,556
save your friends.

841
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,977
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

842
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,941
Unlike you, she's impure.

843
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,821
She wasn't made by nature.

844
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,152
She's a mistake of my own.

845
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,399
I did what I could

846
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,734
and they burned me and beat me.

847
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,618
Your colleagues are savages.

848
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,496
I agree.

849
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,497
The Reavers
were very ineffective.

850
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,580
But I'm bringing
new tools to bear.

851
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:47,744
But I still need someone

852
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:48,971
to point us
in the right direction.

853
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,247
No, I can't help you.

854
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,086
Breathe, breathe.

855
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,250
Now, what does he have?
The old man.

856
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,169
Alzheimer's? ALS?

857
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,922
A degenerative brain disease

858
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,428
in the world's most
dangerous brain?

859
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,350
What a combo.

860
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:08,307
<i>Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.</i>

861
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,520
That's wonderful.

862
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:10,962
<i>Everybody, have a seat.</i>

863
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,314
Nate, sit up.

864
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,163
<i>James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?</i>

865
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,189
<i>You wanna say grace?
Say grace, baby.</i>

866
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,780
Uh, thank you, God,
for this food...

867
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,992
and for our new friends,
the Howletts.

868
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,451
Mmm. They came
to our aid.

869
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,991
Amen.
Amen.

870
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,676
Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.

871
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,543
Thank you, sir.

872
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,384
Mmm-hmm.

873
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,480
Oh, there's plenty more
if she wants.

874
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,232
She's fine. Thank you.

875
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,470
This is delicious.

876
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,952
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

877
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,353
Where are you all headed?

878
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,897
Uh... Oregon.
South Dakota.

879
01:11:58,731 --> 01:11:59,732
Um...

880
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,235
Well, Oregon
and then South Dakota.

881
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,744
Vacation?

882
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:04,904
Uh... Yes.

883
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,073
Uh, long overdue.

884
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,492
We're city folk.

885
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:12,083
Always wanted to take a
road trip, see the country.

886
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,748
Um... And meet
the people in it.

887
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,166
That sounds lovely.

888
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,452
Been trying to get Will here

889
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,044
to take a vacation
for years now.

890
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,854
Oh. If we go traipsing
all over the country,

891
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,022
who's gonna take care
of this place?

892
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,923
Exactly.
I say, let it go.

893
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,091
And live off what?

894
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,010
The Lord will provide.

895
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,029
I'm still waiting for
the Lord to provide me

896
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,270
with a new thresher.

897
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,389
All the same,
I'd love to travel someday.

898
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,771
And I bet you will.

899
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,411
I could drop out of school.

900
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,496
Okay, let's not go that far.

901
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,612
I mean, I'll do it.

902
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,971
No. No.
NATE; Why not?

903
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,449
You wanna travel,
I wanna travel.

904
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,525
Son. Son.

905
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,086
That sounds good to you, right?

906
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,407
This is the perfect plan.

907
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,970
Why would you want
to do that, Nate?

908
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,120
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

909
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,123
for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?

910
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,621
Yes, it was a.-.

911
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,421
It was a special needs
school. Um...

912
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,132
Uh-huh.
That's a good description.

913
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,301
He was there, too.

914
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,464
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

915
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,750
I got kicked out a few times.

916
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,552
I wish I could say
you were a good pupil,

917
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,932
but the words would choke me.

918
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,578
Ma'am, I can't thank you
enough for this.

919
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,004
Uh, it was great.

920
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,961
But we have along drive
ahead of us, so...

921
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,392
But you need to rest,
don't you'?

922
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,056
Yeah, we'll find
a motel somewhere.

923
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,145
The nearest one
is two hours from here

924
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,289
and it's not even that nice.

925
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,513
We have a perfectly fine
room upstairs

926
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,774
for your father
and your daughter and

927
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,484
you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

928
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,777
Kathryn, it's very,
very nice of you,

929
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,018
but we really should go.

930
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,309
We can leave
early in the morning.

931
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:57,772
Break of dawn, as it were.

932
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,446
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

933
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,606
Okay.

934
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:04,690
Sit.

935
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,655
Um, sweetie,
you want some dessert?

936
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,118
Two days on the road,

937
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,121
only one meal,
and hardly any sleep.

938
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,331
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

939
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,337
Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.

940
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,498
I'm not a box
of avocados, Logan.

941
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,434
And then what? We
stay the night, then what?

942
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,962
Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.

943
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,558
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

944
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,477
Take the pills.

945
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,891
Oh, shit!

946
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,061
What's going on?
Nate!

947
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,230
Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.

948
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,740
Honey, check the sink.

949
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,320
They shut it off again.

950
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,628
They are just not going to
let this thing go.

951
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,132
Well, you might as well
handle it now.

952
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,131
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

953
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,498
We got three houseguests

954
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,613
and a sink full of dishes.

955
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,368
All right, all right.

956
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,666
The pump station
that supplies us

957
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,985
is a mile and a half from here.

958
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,878
Sometimes it gets itself
shut off.

959
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,041
- By assholes.
- Hey!

960
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,209
No.

961
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,507
My son is happy to go with you.

962
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,422
No, no, no, that's fine.

963
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,431
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

964
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,342
I can go.
No, you got homework.

965
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,011
All right, I'll go.

966
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,895
Just, uh,
let me get my dad settled.

967
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:21,726
All right.

968
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,772
I'm just saying, I don't
care what the lawyer says.

969
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,227
But it's dangerous.

970
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,402
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

971
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,630
Want TV? There's TV here.

972
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,793
I'm fine.

973
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,044
Okay. Get some rest.

974
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,130
You know, Logan...

975
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,887
this is what life looks like.

976
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,928
A home,
people who love each other.

977
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,266
Safe place.

978
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,978
You should
take a moment and feel it.

979
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,777
Yeah. It's great.

980
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,483
Logan. Logan!

981
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,568
You still have time.

982
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:18,241
Charles, the world is not
the same as it was.

983
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,333
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

984
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,587
And where we're going, Eden...

985
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,835
it doesn't exist.

986
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,925
Her nurse got it
from a comic book.

987
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,176
You understand?
It's not real.

988
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,936
It is for Laura.

989
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,188
It is for Laura.

990
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,488
Get some rest.

991
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,951
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here,

992
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,199
except for us.

993
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,990
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

994
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,783
then screwing with our water.

995
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,287
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

996
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,544
So, out on the highway
today, those trucks...

997
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,217
Who knows. Maybe.

998
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,379
Hey, look at 'em.

999
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,806
Look like dinosaurs
with their 20-ton bodies

1000
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,224
and tiny little brains...

1001
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,556
shucking their cloned-up
super corn.

1002
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,038
You know it tastes
like shit, too.

1003
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,389
Why do people eat it?

1004
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,899
They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.

1005
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,857
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

1006
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:30,571
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

1007
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,573
Used to be a time when a bad
day was just a bad day.

1008
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,154
Mine still are.

1009
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,842
Those are for breakaway roping.

1010
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,678
Those are for barrel racing...

1011
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,930
and right here
is for pole bending.

1012
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,940
They're all second, third place.

1013
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,729
I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.

1014
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,413
Do you want to listen?

1015
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,799
Do you like it?

1016
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,098
Um, here, you can
take it for tonight...

1017
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,305
and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.

1018
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,241
Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.

1019
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,980
Should hold it.

1020
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,268
Yeah.

1021
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,112
Till next time.

1022
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,814
Thanks.

1023
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,118
Hey, so, uh, how
long has your girl

1024
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,820
been like that?
Huh?

1025
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,367
Mute.

1026
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:48,497
Uh, since the beginning.

1027
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,035
Mmm.

1028
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,713
Well, in a lot of ways,
I envy you.

1029
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,961
They get to be Nate's age,

1030
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,040
with the nonsense that comes
out of their mouths...

1031
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,304
Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.

1032
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,220
Shit.

1033
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,388
Don't worry.

1034
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,023
We won't need it.

1035
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,474
Stay here.

1036
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,195
Evening, Mr. Munson.

1037
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,814
What brings y'all this way?

1038
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,324
Why don't you ask your boys?

1039
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,659
Mr. Munson,

1040
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,466
you understand you're
trespassing right now, right?

1041
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,051
I have an easement with
the previous owner

1042
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,076
of your property.

1043
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,503
Huh. Bullshit.

1044
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,663
"Previous" being
the operative word.

1045
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,090
Who's this?

1046
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,418
Just a guy telling you

1047
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,920
to get back in your nice truck.

1048
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,760
Go play Okie dickhead
somewhere else.

1049
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,265
Hey, Carl...

1050
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,186
it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.

1051
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,692
Looks that way.

1052
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,272
He's a friend of mine.

1053
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,108
A friend with a big mouth.

1054
01:20:58,437 --> 01:20:59,689
I hear that a lot.

1055
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,495
Then you probably
hear this, too.

1056
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,615
More than I'd like.

1057
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:06,950
Then you know the drill.

1058
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,956
I'mma count to three...

1059
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,515
and you're gonna
start walking away.

1060
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,677
I got rights to this water.

1061
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,873
One.
I have a lawyer now.

1062
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:14,953
Two.

1063
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,044
Three.
Ah. Ah.

1064
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,542
You all right, boss?

1065
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,105
You know the drill. JACKSON:
Pick up my goddamn hat.

1066
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,130
Get the hell out of here.

1067
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,140
You okay, boss?
Fuck off.

1068
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,217
Go!

1069
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,739
You've had training.

1070
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,283
Some.

1071
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,134
Hey, don't wake her yet.

1072
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,932
Let her sleep another hour.

1073
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,018
You know, Logan...

1074
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,690
this was, without a doubt...

1075
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:29,821
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

1076
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,876
But I don't deserve it.

1077
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,042
Do I?

1078
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,806
I did something.

1079
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,890
Something unspeakable.

1080
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:03,403
I've remembered
what happened in Westchester.

1081
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,370
This is not the first time
I've hurt people.

1082
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,663
Until today, I didn't know.

1083
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,578
You wouldn't tell me.

1084
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:27,754
So we just kept on
running away from it.

1085
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:35,895
I think I finally
understand you.

1086
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,561
Logan...

1087
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,636
He's fantastic.

1088
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:11,138
You said you only needed
the girl!

1089
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,424
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

1090
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,807
Your friends had every chance.

1091
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,139
And so did you.

1092
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,394
Nate?

1093
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,483
Put her down.

1094
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:32,989
Honey.

1095
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,112
Stay down there, Will!

1096
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:38,447
Stop!

1097
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,856
Kathryn!

1098
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,637
Kathryn!

1099
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,004
Kathryn!

1100
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:13,529
Charles!

1101
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,782
Charles!

1102
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,125
Hold this.

1103
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,465
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

1104
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:36,048
Here he comes.

1105
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,137
I could pick him up,

1106
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:39,217
meet him halfway.

1107
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,852
No, no, no.
Let them come to us.

1108
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:43,139
We struggled
with the X-23s.

1109
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,532
We assumed,
because they were children...

1110
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,992
we could raise them
without a conscience.

1111
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:47,893
But you can't nurture rage.

1112
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,232
You must simply design it...

1113
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,395
from scratch.

1114
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,414
Who the fuck is that?

1115
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:06,579
Will Munson!

1116
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,170
Just hold on, Charles.

1117
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,923
Munson, God
damn it, come out here!

1118
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,257
Munson!

1119
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,431
Come out here now!

1120
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,767
Come out here now, Munson.

1121
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,227
There's that asshole.

1122
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,568
Hello, asshole.

1123
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:32,605
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1124
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,781
I don't know what
Munson's paying you...

1125
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:37,951
but Canewood can start
you out at five G.

1126
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,115
A week, that is.

1127
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,365
You best stay
where you are, pal.

1128
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,284
I'm the law out here.

1129
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,870
No, no, no.

1130
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,247
What in high...

1131
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,880
What? Oh, shit!

1132
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,043
Shoot him!

1133
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,137
We need to intervene.

1134
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,549
Well, he only listens
to you, Doctor.

1135
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,594
24!

1136
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:06,888
Get back here!

1137
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,145
Stop! Stop now!

1138
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,150
Hold this down,
right now, tight!

1139
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,316
Our boat.
What?

1140
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,907
The Sunseeker.

1141
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,584
No.

1142
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:45,469
Come!

1143
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:46,803
24!

1144
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,101
Need some help out here!

1145
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,617
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

1146
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,161
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1147
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,990
Get your lily-faced
ass out here!

1148
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,365
Listen to me!

1149
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,087
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

1150
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,119
All right, we gotta
go around that truck

1151
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,495
and flank them farmers.

1152
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:08,954
Follow my lead.

1153
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,957
Bring extra ammo,
take these clips.

1154
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,083
Come!

1155
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,546
Now!

1156
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,715
Pick her up.

1157
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:27,723
Beware the light.

1158
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,331
What the hell are you?

1159
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,559
Sit down.

1160
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,166
Hold still.

1161
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:42,922
Hold still.

1162
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,056
Get him on the truck.

1163
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:07,105
MAN 23 Yeah.

1164
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,025
Go.

1165
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,537
It's all right, it's all right.

1166
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:20,623
It's all right.
You did fine, 24.

1167
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,753
You're healing.
Just breathe.

1168
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,625
You're a newborn,
by any measure.

1169
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,088
Just breathe.

1170
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,510
Your body has work to do.

1171
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,263
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

1172
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:33,765
stromal cell proliferation.

1173
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:37,431
This will help you heal.

1174
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:39,805
Make you stronger.

1175
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,073
Well...

1176
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,876
It's got water, and...

1177
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,234
It's got water.

1178
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,420
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1179
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,014
God!

1180
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,106
Fuck! Fuck!

1181
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,273
Fuck!

1182
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:52,937
Shit!

1183
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:06,789
Fuck! Fuck!

1184
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:10,125
Fuck!

1185
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,915
Motherfucking...

1186
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:17,299
Shit!

1187
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,511
Fuck! Fuck!

1188
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:49,961
Welcome back.

1189
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,514
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

1190
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,418
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1191
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,042
her daddy's gone.

1192
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,390
I'd always hoped...

1193
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:08,646
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

1194
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,686
There's so few of you left.

1195
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,357
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1196
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,830
But I really
got to get on my way.

1197
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,071
No, no, don't do that.

1198
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,700
What you need is rest,
and treatment.

1199
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:22,378
You need to check yourself
in somewhere.

1200
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,574
I'll be fine.

1201
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:24,867
No, you're not!

1202
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:28,033
I mean, I know
that you're different...

1203
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,468
but that doesn't change the fact

1204
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:31,494
that something inside you
is poisoning you.

1205
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,880
You got to check yourself
into a hospital.

1206
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,711
Find out what it is!

1207
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,382
I know what it is.

1208
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,504
Please, mister, if you don't
want to go to a hospital,

1209
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,587
maybe I can help you.

1210
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,006
Maybe I can run some tests.

1211
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:45,550
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

1212
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:47,390
You wanna save a life,
save your own.

1213
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:48,599
Forget we were here.

1214
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:49,853
Let's go.

1215
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,025
Hey!

1216
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:03,568
Hey!

1217
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,090
You can't just take shit,
you know.

1218
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,828
I don't know
how you got me here...

1219
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:48,784
but thank you.

1220
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:49,864
<i>De nada.</i>

1221
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:51,245
Yeah.

1222
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,460
You can talk?

1223
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:57,831
You can talk?

1224
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,416
What the fuck?

1225
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:01,751
Why in the fuck...

1226
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:02,936
What's all this bullshit been

1227
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,928
for the last
2,000 fucking miles?

1228
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:09,597
What? Shut up.

1229
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:10,931
Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,729
Jonah, Gideon,
Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.

1231
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,103
What? Who's that?

1232
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,437
Who is that?

1233
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,360
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.

1234
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:23,902
North Dakota.

1235
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,154
What?

1236
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:27,652
North Dakota, por favor.

1237
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:28,949
Shit, okay. Look...

1238
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,200
<i>No. Por favor.</i>

1239
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,496
This place. Okay?

1240
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:34,784
Your nurse,

1241
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,165
she read too many stories,
you understand?

1242
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,875
Too many stories!

1243
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,507
I've seen it!
I've seen it, okay?

1244
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:46,796
This all here.“

1245
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,965
<i>None of this...
No existo, okay?</i>

1246
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:50,049
You understand me?

1247
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:51,513
This Eden
does not exist. No!

1248
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:52,973
<i>Si! Edam!</i>

1249
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:54,979
It's a fantasy, kid.
See that?

1250
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,156
Those are the names
of the people

1251
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,978
who just made this...

1252
01:38:58,057 --> 01:38:59,855
They made this whole thing up.

1253
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,648
Okay? This whole...

1254
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:02,811
It happened once,

1255
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:04,734
and they just turned it
into a big, fucking lie!

1256
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:07,191
That's all this is. No!

1257
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,026
Fuck.

1258
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:10,987
No.

1259
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,364
I know, I understand.

1260
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,662
This is along way.

1261
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:16,825
You understand?

1262
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,246
I am not taking you
to North Dakota.

1263
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:25,715
I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.

1264
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:29,006
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

1265
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,891
Don't fucking hit me!

1266
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:33,050
Don't hit me!

1267
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,057
Jonah, Gideon...

1268
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:36,321
Stop saying those names.
Rebecca...

1269
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:37,346
Delilah, Rictor.

1270
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:38,932
Right now.
Stop saying those names.

1271
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:40,228
Stop it! Stop!

1272
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:41,521
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

1273
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:44,062
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

1274
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,193
You wanna go'?

1275
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,115
I'll take you there.

1276
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,068
See for yourself.

1277
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:52,654
Let's go to fucking fantasy land.

1278
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:06,935
<i>We understand the importance</i>

1279
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:07,960
<i>of containment, Dr. Rice.</i>

1280
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,396
But you can't leave
a war zone behind

1281
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,421
like you did in Juarez.

1282
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:11,773
Well, try to remind yourselves

1283
01:40:11,797 --> 01:40:13,192
that these are all
little killing machines.

1284
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,235
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

1285
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:16,260
Not all.

1286
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,271
I was told you want
these assets off-board,

1287
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:20,480
dead or alive.

1288
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:21,892
Are you changing my brief?

1289
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:23,105
No.

1290
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,606
All right, then.

1291
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:27,563
Save tissue from this one.

1292
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,824
He's a good tracker
and had a high IQ.

1293
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:36,615
Here you go.

1294
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:14,360
Hey.

1295
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,160
Hmm'?

1296
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:24,666
Let me drive.

1297
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:28,633
Absolutely not.

1298
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:35,844
Quit looking at me.

1299
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:41,513
<i>No comprende.</i>

1300
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,516
You are dying.

1301
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:48,861
You want to die.

1302
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,233
Charles told me.

1303
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,579
What else did he tell you?

1304
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,577
To not let you.

1305
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,553
Hey, hey, hey!

1306
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:22,762
Rest.

1307
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:08,845
Keep it steady.

1308
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,773
Swing him toward me.

1309
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:16,268
Yeah.

1310
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:21,073
Easy. Easy

1311
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:55,983
Is this good' Rictor?

1312
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:57,650
No, not so much. Less.

1313
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,409
Hey!

1314
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,246
Where am I?

1315
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,792
Hey, what is it?

1316
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:18,459
Where did you get that?

1317
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:19,965
Where we came from.

1318
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:21,624
They gave it to us

1319
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:22,811
when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

1320
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,633
It makes you crazy,
is what it does.

1321
01:46:24,753 --> 01:46:25,754
It'll kill you.

1322
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:27,840
No, not if you use it
in small doses.

1323
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:29,804
It's helping you heal.

1324
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:32,645
Where's Laura?

1325
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,771
She's asleep down there.

1326
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,807
Do you want me to wake her up'?

1327
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,657
No.

1328
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:08,555
You had a nightmare.

1329
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,182
Do you have nightmares?

1330
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:16,472
Si.

1331
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:21,310
People hurt me.

1332
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:24,856
Mine are different.

1333
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:32,496
I hurt people.

1334
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,886
You know what it is.

1335
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,594
It's made out of Adamantium.

1336
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,606
It's what they put inside of us.

1337
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:01,354
That's why it can kill us.

1338
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,529
Probably what is killing me now.

1339
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:08,861
Anyway...

1340
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:11,193
I got this a long time ago...

1341
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:16,073
and I kept it as a reminder
of what I am.

1342
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:20,251
Now I keep it to, uh...

1343
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:28,423
Actually, uh...

1344
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,133
I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.

1345
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:36,260
Like Charles said.

1346
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,942
I've hurt people, too.

1347
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:49,781
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1348
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:01,326
They were bad people.

1349
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:06,795
All the same.

1350
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:24,077
Not funny.
That is not funny!

1351
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,045
Hey! Hey, pal.

1352
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:29,548
How long have I been out?

1353
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:32,446
How long have I been
in that bed?

1354
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:33,840
Two days.

1355
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:35,313
You've been sitting here
for two days?

1356
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:36,898
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

1357
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:38,642
You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.

1358
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:40,551
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1359
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:43,061
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1360
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,220
If you keep waiting,

1361
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:45,865
Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.

1362
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:46,936
You need to get out!

1363
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:49,109
We're leaving tomorrow
before dawn.

1364
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:51,111
We're gonna cross the border.

1365
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,897
It's a safe haven.

1366
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:55,358
Same coordinates?

1367
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:57,743
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1368
01:50:57,901 --> 01:51:00,245
<i>Satellites are blind then.</i>

1369
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:01,496
<i>Your asylum approved.</i>

1370
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:02,705
COPY!

1371
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,428
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1372
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:25,770
A little more. Yeah.

1373
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:27,272
You see the woods?

1374
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:30,483
Si.

1375
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,539
It's an eight mile hike
through there.

1376
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:34,771
And you see that pass?

1377
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,110
Mm-hmm.

1378
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,399
That's the border.

1379
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,119
That's where we will be safe.

1380
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:49,957
Come inside.

1381
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,340
Laura told me
all that you did for her.

1382
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:00,843
She was lucky to have you.

1383
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,268
Take it.
She says it's yours.

1384
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:09,686
That's why you did it, right?

1385
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:13,686
Yeah, well...

1386
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:17,322
Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?

1387
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:19,321
Suit yourself.

1388
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:42,636
Your friends, they seem nice.

1389
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:43,845
Kind of reminds me...

1390
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:46,977
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1391
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:48,470
Huh?

1392
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,390
You're with your pals.
You made it.

1393
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:53,893
Where will you go?

1394
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,520
Nearest bar, for starters.

1395
01:52:57,854 --> 01:53:00,323
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

1396
01:53:00,482 --> 01:53:02,359
I even gave back the money.

1397
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:03,573
Such a nice man.

1398
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,867
Hey, I never asked for this!

1399
01:53:06,571 --> 01:53:08,369
All right? Charles
never asked for this.

1400
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:10,409
Caliban never asked for this.

1401
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:13,249
And they are six feet
under the ground!

1402
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:16,373
Now, I don't know what
Charles put in your head...

1403
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,339
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

1404
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:23,009
I only met you,
like, a week ago.

1405
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:26,182
You got your Rebecca,
your Delilah...

1406
01:53:26,341 --> 01:53:28,059
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1407
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:29,845
Everything you asked for,
you've got it!

1408
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:34,766
And it is better this way.

1409
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:38,194
Because I suck at this.

1410
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:43,025
Bad shit happens to people
I care about.

1411
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:44,864
You understand me?

1412
01:53:46,945 --> 01:53:48,447
Then I'll be fine.

1413
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:59,374
Run!
Towards the mountains! Run!

1414
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:10,778
Run, Bobby, run!

1415
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:16,947
Ah!

1416
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:36,383
Go! Go!

1417
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:38,009
Move faster!

1418
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,270
We need to reach them before
they get to the border.

1419
01:58:57,088 --> 01:58:58,340
Move out!

1420
01:58:58,506 --> 01:58:59,507
Let's go, let's go!

1421
01:59:01,343 --> 01:59:02,811
Run! Run!

1422
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:05,563
Corre, Jonah! Run!

1423
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:13,692
I want you to breathe.

1424
01:59:13,855 --> 01:59:15,152
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1425
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:32,415
There she is.

1426
01:59:32,624 --> 01:59:33,671
We got her.

1427
01:59:36,378 --> 01:59:38,472
Back it up! Contain her.

1428
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:06,120
Get behind me!

1429
02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:29,435
You took all the medicine.

1430
02:00:31,015 --> 02:00:32,232
It's wearing off.

1431
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,345
Go to your friends.

1432
02:01:01,588 --> 02:01:02,589
Go.

1433
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,216
Laura?

1434
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:08,561
You'll know when.

1435
02:01:11,556 --> 02:01:12,933
<i>Mucus</i>

1436
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:21,942
Nine o'clock.

1437
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:26,238
That green juice
is wearin' off, huh'?

1438
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,787
You know, for an old mute,
ifs kind of a short high.

1439
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:31,788
Be hard to
keep them claws out, soon.

1440
02:01:31,951 --> 02:01:33,794
Waste this dick, Logan!

1441
02:01:35,038 --> 02:01:36,756
Please stop,
Mr. Hewlett.

1442
02:01:37,207 --> 02:01:38,309
I'm gonna have to tell these men

1443
02:01:38,333 --> 02:01:39,380
to fire on these children.

1444
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:40,885
You don't want that.

1445
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:43,388
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

1446
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:46,140
You will not survive
further wounds.

1447
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:47,929
Allow me to introduce myself.

1448
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:49,302
I'm Zander Rice.

1449
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,564
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

1450
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:56,272
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1451
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:58,778
Yes, he was one of them.

1452
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:01,940
I think I might have killed him.

1453
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:04,400
I think you're right.

1454
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:06,004
Why don't you show
some respect, mutie?

1455
02:02:06,069 --> 02:02:08,037
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

1456
02:02:08,613 --> 02:02:10,536
My friend Donald overstates.

1457
02:02:11,574 --> 02:02:14,293
He makes it sound more brutal
than intended.

1458
02:02:14,452 --> 02:02:17,706
The goal was
not to end mutant kind...

1459
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:19,169
but to control it.

1460
02:02:21,292 --> 02:02:22,418
I realized

1461
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:24,146
we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

1462
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,231
That we could use those products

1463
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:26,302
to perfect ourselves.

1464
02:02:27,423 --> 02:02:28,720
To distribute gene therapy

1465
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,143
discreetly through everything...

1466
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:32,520
from sweet drinks
to breakfast cereals.

1467
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:33,805
And it worked.

1468
02:02:33,972 --> 02:02:36,475
Random mutancy
went the way of polio.

1469
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:37,938
We embarked
on our next endeavor.

1470
02:02:38,142 --> 02:02:39,769
Growing mutants of your own.

1471
02:02:39,936 --> 02:02:40,996
Precisely.
Dangerous times, James.

1472
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:42,021
You can't...

1473
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:43,518
Argh!

1474
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:45,884
Argh!

1475
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,041
Showtime, boy!

1476
02:03:38,745 --> 02:03:40,622
Get up, boy.
Get up, boy!

1477
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:46,760
He did that. Get up!

1478
02:04:00,099 --> 02:04:01,772
Laura! No!

1479
02:04:06,814 --> 02:04:07,815
Laura!

1480
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:56,280
Please.

1481
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:32,191
Ah!

1482
02:05:39,741 --> 02:05:40,788
Go.

1483
02:05:42,577 --> 02:05:43,578
Let's go.

1484
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,121
Go.

1485
02:05:46,581 --> 02:05:48,083
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1486
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,010
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1487
02:05:54,714 --> 02:05:56,842
Go. Go, go, go!

1488
02:06:01,262 --> 02:06:02,684
GO, go!

1489
02:06:02,889 --> 02:06:03,936
Go!

1490
02:06:04,307 --> 02:06:05,354
Run!

1491
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:06,559
No!

1492
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,861
No!

1493
02:06:46,516 --> 02:06:47,984
No, no. No.

1494
02:07:12,917 --> 02:07:14,635
Take your friends, and run.

1495
02:07:14,794 --> 02:07:16,011
No.

1496
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:19,340
Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.

1497
02:07:19,507 --> 02:07:22,181
Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.

1498
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:28,524
Go, go.

1499
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:38,113
Don't be what they made you.

1500
02:07:46,117 --> 02:07:48,336
Laura... Laura.“

1501
02:07:52,748 --> 02:07:53,874
Daddy.

1502
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:05,766
So, this is what it feels like.

1503
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,015
No!

1504
02:08:16,898 --> 02:08:17,899
No!

1505
02:08:31,579 --> 02:08:32,705
Daddy.

1506
02:08:33,414 --> 02:08:34,415
Dad.

1507
02:09:06,322 --> 02:09:09,166
"A man has to be
what he is, Joey."

1508
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:12,207
"Can't break the mold."

1509
02:09:15,081 --> 02:09:17,584
"There's no living
with a killing."

1510
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:20,632
"There's no going back."

1511
02:09:22,797 --> 02:09:24,674
"Right or wrong, it's a brand."

1512
02:09:25,549 --> 02:09:27,472
"A brand that sticks."

1513
02:09:30,513 --> 02:09:32,857
"Now you run on home
to your mother."

1514
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:37,528
"You tell her
everything's all right."

1515
02:09:39,105 --> 02:09:42,450
"There are no more guns
in the valley."

1516
02:09:59,292 --> 02:10:01,294
Let's go.
We gotta move.

1517
02:11:17,203 --> 02:11:20,924
<i>There's a man goin' 'round
takin' names</i>

1518
02:11:21,916 --> 02:11:25,762
<i>And he decides who to free
and who to blame</i>

1519
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:30,808
<i>Everybody won't be treated
all the same</i>

1520
02:11:32,176 --> 02:11:35,305
<i>There?! be a golden {adder
reaching down</i>

1521
02:11:38,391 --> 02:11:40,940
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1522
02:11:44,688 --> 02:11:48,318
<i>The hairs on your arm
will stand up</i>

1523
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:53,240
<i>At the tenor in each sip
and in each sup</i>

1524
02:11:54,782 --> 02:11:58,127
<i>For you partake
of that last offered cup</i>

1525
02:11:59,662 --> 02:12:03,212
<i>O1 disappear
into the putters ground</i>

1526
02:12:05,709 --> 02:12:07,711
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1527
02:12:09,839 --> 02:12:12,558
<i>Hear the trumpets
hear the pipers</i>

1528
02:12:14,343 --> 02:12:17,472
<i>One hundred million
angels singing</i>

1529
02:12:19,557 --> 02:12:24,233
<i>Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum</i>

1530
02:12:25,771 --> 02:12:28,991
<i>Voices callin', voices cryin'</i>

1531
02:12:30,693 --> 02:12:33,867
<i>Some are born an' some are dyin'</i>

1532
02:12:35,156 --> 02:12:38,877
<i>It's Alpha's and Omega's
kingdom come</i>

1533
02:12:40,035 --> 02:12:44,256
<i>And the whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1534
02:12:45,374 --> 02:12:48,628
<i>"(he virgins are all

1535

<i>The whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1536
02:12:55,176 --> 02:12:58,771
<i>It's hard for thee
to kick against the pricks</i>

1537
02:13:02,349 --> 02:13:06,024
<i>Till Armageddon
no Shalam, no Shalom</i>

1538
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:10,946
<i>Then the father hen will
call his chickens home</i>

1539
02:13:12,443 --> 02:13:15,617
<i>The wise men will bow down
before the throne</i>

1540
02:13:17,323 --> 02:13:20,748
<i>And at his feet they?!
cast their golden crown</i>

1541
02:13:23,412 --> 02:13:25,790
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1542
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:31,880
<i>Whoever is unjust

1543
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:36,885
<i>Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still</i>

1544
02:13:37,176 --> 02:13:41,727
<i>Whoever is filthy
let him be filthy still</i>

1545
02:13:42,181 --> 02:13:45,355
<i>Listen to the words
long written down</i>

1546
