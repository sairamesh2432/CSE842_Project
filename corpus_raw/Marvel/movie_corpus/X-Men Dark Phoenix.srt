Be right back.

187
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,809
Oh, shit.

188
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,512
- Strap in, we're headed home.
- ASTRONAUT: Wait.

189
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,401
Our commander, he's not here.

190
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,036
He was in the airlock
working on the thruster.

191
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,164
The heat signature's
rising fast.

192
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,371
I can't hold it any longer.

193
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,127
We gotta get out of here.
I said strap in.

194
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,630
No, Raven. No.
We're not leaving anyone behind.

195
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,053
I am not putting this team
in more danger.

196
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,131
What about their team?

197
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,625
Jean can hold
that shuttle together.

198
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,516
Can't you, Jean?

199
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,766
You know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

200
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,564
I can hold the ship together
but not from here.

201
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,063
- I need to get inside.
- The heat's spiking.

202
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,965
We've got less than a minute
till those flares hit.

203
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,320
She said she can do it.

204
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,315
Thirty seconds.

205
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,779
Count it down. Go.

206
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,993
(alarm blaring)

207
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,049
(metal creaking)

208
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,966
(beeping)

209
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,722
We got 20 seconds.

210
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,277
Ten...

211
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,356
nine, eight...

212
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,156
seven, six...

213
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,952
five...

214
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,447
four...

215
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,744
three...

216
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,991
two...

217
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,083
one.

218
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,625
(groans)

219
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,377
SCOTT: Where's Jean?
Kurt, where is she?

220
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,710
- Where is she?
- (gasping): I'm sorry!

221
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,841
(alarm blaring)

222
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,885
Brace for impact.

223
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,019
(labored breathing)

224
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,778
(panting)

225
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,450
(panting)

226
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,661
(screaming)

227
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,191
♪♪

228
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,889
♪♪

229
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,949
(weakly): Is every...

230
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,532
Is everybody okay?

231
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,702
Yeah, we're okay.
(gasps, sighs)

232
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,377
(sighs)

233
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,211
So let's go home.

234
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,057
(cheering, whistling)

235
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,345
- Yay, X-Men! Woo!
- Yeah!

236
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,431
(cheering)

237
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,481
Yeah! X-Men!

238
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,688
(cheering, whistling)

239
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,525
(children chanting)

240
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,712
(cheering, whistling)

241
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,289
(CHARLES chuckling)

242
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,839
CHARLES: That's enough,
boys and girls. That's enough.

243
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,931
The X-Men have today done
an incredibly brave thing.

244
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,760
They've once again proved to humanity
exactly why they need us,

245
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,015
people like yourselves.

246
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,938
The president sends his regards,

247
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,061
as well as his
heartfelt gratitude.

248
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,895
And, as for myself,
I've never been prouder.

249
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,861
Enjoy yourselves.
You certainly deserve it.

250
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,158
In fact, you all do.

251
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,610
No more class,
the end of the day.

252
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,911
(cheers)

253
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,541
Jean?

254
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,951
You gave us quite a scare up there.
How are you feeling?

255
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,873
(stammers)
Actually, I... I feel fine.

256
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,003
- Hank?
- Yeah?

257
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,196
Would you take a look at Jean?

258
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,552
Standard medical
for anyone injured in the field.

259
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,004
Thank you.

260
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,976
RAVEN: You know, the president
was almost sending his condolences.

261
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,646
- She should be dead.
- Thankfully, she's not.

262
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,105
I basically did everything.

263
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,561
I mean, Jean did a little,
like towards the end,

264
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,362
but it was mostly all me.

265
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,408
(door closes)

266
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,110
You put us in danger, Charles.

267
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,038
You put those kids in danger.

268
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,293
They're not kids anymore, Raven.

269
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,872
And I care about their safety
just as much as you do.

270
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,128
Are you sure about that?

271
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,801
'Cause we're taking bigger
and bigger risks.

272
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,969
And for what?

273
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,094
Please, tell me it's not your ego.

274
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,891
Being on the cover
of magazines,

275
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,014
getting a medal from the president.

276
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,470
You like it, don't you?

277
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,521
As opposed to being
hunted and despised?

278
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,974
Well, you know, actually, I do.

279
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,151
It's all just a means
to an end, Raven.

280
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,774
- What end is that?
- Keeping us safe.

281
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,259
You should understand
better than anyone

282
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,194
that we're only ever
one bad day away

283
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,526
from them starting to see us
as the enemy again.

284
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,862
So, what?
We wear matching costumes

285
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,434
and smile in pictures
to make everyone feel safe?

286
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,186
That is a small price to pay
for keeping the peace.

287
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,452
- By risking our people to save theirs?
- Yes! Yes!

288
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,378
It's funny.

289
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,551
I can't actually remember the last time

290
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,094
you were the one risking something.

291
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,637
And by the way,

292
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,136
the women are always saving
the men around here.

293
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,639
You might wanna think about
changing the name to X-Women.

294
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,765
(door opens)

295
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,347
HANK: Your heartbeat's strong,
pulse is good,

296
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,307
brain activity is normal.

297
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,654
The genetic reading,

298
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,854
I'm gonna take another look at.

299
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,734
What can't be right?

300
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,516
Did you just read my mind
without permission?

301
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,658
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
but what can't be right?

302
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,879
Whatever happened up there
made you stronger.

303
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,736
You know, I've never seen
a power reading like this.

304
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,048
You're-You're literally...
I mean, you're off the charts.

305
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,380
So what does that mean?

306
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,715
It means, um...

307
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,306
we'll have to build a better machine.

308
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,560
But... how do you feel?

309
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,059
I feel good.

310
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,394
Good.

311
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,901
Well, as far as I can tell,
you're good to go.

312
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,199
- You can head upstairs.
- All right.

313
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,986
Thanks, Hank.

314
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,743
SCOTT:
Hank said that?

315
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,453
- "Off the charts"?
- He did.

316
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,504
The big blue furry guy?
The doctor? That Hank?

317
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,082
JEAN:
That's the one. Why?

318
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,503
You a little intimidated, maybe?

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,589
Constantly.

320
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,683
- Jean. Jean...
- Hmm?

321
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,100
Are you...
Are you sure you're okay?

322
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,692
I'm better than okay.
God, I feel great, I do.

323
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,317
I don't know, I feel like
everything is just...

324
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,148
turned up.

325
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,942
Yeah.

326
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,155
- No, it's just...
- Just what?

327
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,160
I thought I lost you today.

328
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,744
I know.

329
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,585
But I came back to you.

330
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,801
I'll always come back to you.

331
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,436
(distant voices chattering)

332
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,515
(distant dog barking)

333
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,980
(up-tempo music playing)

334
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,154
(music grows louder)

335
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,912
(lively chattering)

336
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,955
(barking continuing)

337
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,251
Is that Luna?

338
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,212
Probably just squirrels.

339
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,258
- (Luna barking)
- Mm...?

340
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,507
I'm just gonna check on her.
I'll be right back.

341
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,633
Just stay.

342
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,767
- Tell her to shut up.
- Luna!

343
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,595
(Luna barking)

344
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,647
Luna!

345
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,861
(barking continuing)

346
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,042
Luna!

347
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,242
(shushes)

348
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,667
Honey!

349
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,540
(shushing)

350
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,838
What is it?
What is it, honey?

351
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,303
(whines)

352
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,388
(Luna barking)

353
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,142
(woman panting)

354
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,227
- (gasps)
- (Luna yelps)

355
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,199
(flesh squelching)

356
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,279
- (laughter)
- He's got the dumbest laugh.

357
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,658
That's not...

358
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,535
That's not how it happened.

359
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,084
- Oh, my God.
- That was...

360
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,544
MAN:
Margaret?

361
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,966
What...?

362
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,173
(groans)

363
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,803
(woman screaming)

364
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,680
(all clamoring)

365
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,223
(lively chattering)

366

We changed the world

Yeah, but maybe
that's what we should go do.

Yeah, but this is our life.
This is what we wanted.

It's not our life, Hank.
It's his.

What do you think the "X"

Charles and his X-Men

Thank you.

413
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,793

414
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,964
Now, I know that some of you
choose to call us "superheroes."

415
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,963
I must confess, I don't really
know what that word means,

416
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,282

721
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,798
(chuckles)

722
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,519
She was just
this little girl, and...

723
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,393
she'd broken in,
looking for food.

724
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,558
I said she could stay,

725
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,860
and that she'd never have
to go hungry again.

726
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,236
And then, I think
I promised her a better life.

727
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,115
And then you took it from her.

728
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,822
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

729
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,283
- Hank...
- This is your fault, Charles.

730
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,919
It's your fault she's dead.

731
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,793
- Come on, that's not fair.
- Fair? No, don't talk about fair.

732
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,653
You messed with the mind
of an eight-year-old girl.

733
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,155
You pushed down
all that pain and anger...

734
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,490
- Jean?
- ...where do you think it's gonna go?

735
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,970
I did that to help her.
What I do,

736
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,659
- I do to help all of them.
- Please, come on, please.

737
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,971
- You still can't see what you did wrong?
- It's just...

738
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,599
No, you need to face this, Charles!
You need to face it.

739
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,369
Come on, admit it
to me right now. Come on!

740
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,640
Admit it!

741
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,018
Charles, just admit
you were wrong, please.

742
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,865
You still can't.

743
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,996
I really hope
you feel better, Hank.

744
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,746
I hope that railing on me five minutes
after I put my foster sister in the grave

745
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,314
- has made you feel...
- This isn't about me.

746
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,274
You, know what? I know what
I did wrong, okay, Charles?

747
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,710
She was gonna leave.
Raven was gonna leave,

748
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,213
and I talked her out of it.

749
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,797
She saw what the rest of us didn't.

750
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,060
And what was that?

751
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,476
This whole time,
we've been trying

752
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,043
to protect these kids from the world,

753
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,472
when really, we should've been
protecting them from you.

00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,864
I don't know
what's happening to me.

756
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,448

757
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,949

supposed to be?

We're the ones who are going
to help you, Mr. Grey.

763
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,765
I didn't know
she was gonna come back.

764
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,435
I'm sorry for all this.

765
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,434
It's okay.

766

We just wanna get an accurate
picture of who Jean is.

Tell us about when you
gave her to the mutant.

Maybe, uh...

770
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,626
it might be better
if I talk to a lawyer.

771
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,594
I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey,

772
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,142
but I need to know
everything about her now.

773

an unfortunate development.

Why-Why is that?

775

01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:35,969
(grunting)

1076
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,766
CHARLES:
Kurt, get me inside.

1077
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,850
You're not the only one
who can control minds.

1078
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:42,976
- Kurt!
- (yells)

1079
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,318
(grunting)

1080
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,998
(passengers screaming)

1081
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:17,549
(grunts)

1082
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,659
They're coming to kill you.
You're not gonna let them.

1083
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,365
You're gonna fight back.

1084
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,749
(growls)

1085
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,011
Feel the power inside you.

1086
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,180
The power is you.

1087
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,266
(grunts)

1088
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,892
(rumbling)

1089
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,245
(passengers screaming)

1090
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,664
Hold them!

1091
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,892
I know whose blood that was.

1092
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,441
You cast me out.

1093
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,235
Now you come here to kill me?

1094
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,946
That's right.

1095
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,963
And you couldn't even do that.

1096
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,220
Let me show you how.

1097
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,315
(ERIK gasps)

1098
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,482
- (metal creaking)
- (groaning)

1099
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,404
(ERIK screams)

1100
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,114
(gasps)

1101
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,587
(grunts)

1102
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,836
(indistinct shouting)

1103
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,973
CHARLES:
Scott, a little help?

1104
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,687
- (groans)
- Kurt!

1105
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,143
Kurt! Kurt?

1106
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,353
- You all right?
- No!

1107
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,190
Come here!
Get me in that house now!

1108
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,574
Have you come to kill me, too?

1109
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,870
Never.

1110
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,489
Jean, never!

1111
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,451
I failed you.
I know that, but...

1112
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,832
this isn't you.

1113
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,831
- (screams)
- CHARLES: Kurt!

1114
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:41,844
- Jean, please!
- You have no idea who I am.

1115
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,138
I've raised you
since you were a little girl.

1116
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,260
I think I do.

1117
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,681
She's not your little girl anymore.

1118
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,314
Who...

1119
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,475
What are you?

1120
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,773
Jean, please try and remember
what I taught you.

1121
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,027
You can control it.

1122
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,986
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

1123
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,616
So show me.

1124
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,657
Walk to me.

1125
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:15,922
You know I can't.

1126
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:17,924
(CHARLES grunts)

1127
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,220
No!
(groaning)

1128
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,131
(metal creaking)

1129
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,640
Please, Jean.

1130
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,772
Please.

1131
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,660
(panting)

1132
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,708
I can't see
in your mind anymore...

1133
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,002
but you can see in mine.

1134
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,468
So look.

1135
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,634
Jean, look.

1136
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,793
CHARLES: And what you choose
to do with your gift,

1137
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,354
well, that's entirely up to you.

1138
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,776
(CHARLES groans)

1139
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,524
This could be your new home.

1140
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,690
We could be your new family.

1141
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,244
No!

1142
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,992
Because you are not broken.

1143
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,414
(groaning)

1144
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,340
Then you'll take her?

1145
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,008
Yes.

1146
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,181
No!

1147
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,801
I can help her in ways
that you can't.

1148
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,141
She can't be helped.

1149
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,389
She's a lost cause.

1150
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,478
(groans)

1151
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,735
CHARLES:
No, she's not.

1152
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,154
As long as there's someone
to care for her, who believes,

1153
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,322
then there's still hope.

1154
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,693
(CHARLES grunting)

1155
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,863
Then there...

1156
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,698
There's still hope.

1157
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,549
(panting)

1158
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,428
I knew. I knew
you were still in there.

1159
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,307
VUK:
He just showed you your past.

1160
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,479
Follow me...

1161
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,686
into your future.

1162
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,741
No.

1163
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,285
(brakes screech)

1164
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,840
GUARD (over radio):
Set weapons to neutralize.

1165
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,124
I never asked for this.

1166
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,701
Any of it.

1167
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:05,543
I traveled to the stars
for a gift that you don't want.

1168
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,676
Then take it.

1169
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,471
Please.

1170
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,015
Free me.

1171
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,554
I'll try.

1172
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,157
(all grunting)

1173
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:44,714
(growls)

1174
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,585
(groans)

1175
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,521
(gasping)

1176
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,693
Stop it.
You're going to kill her.

1177
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,405
(whispering):
Your lives mean nothing.

1178
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:16,702
Your world will be ours.

1179
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,575
You'd kill us all.

1180
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,496
Yes.

1181
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,661
Jean, you have to let go.

1182
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,166
Jean, let go!

1183
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,082
Let go, Jean. Let go!

1184
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,503
Let go!

1185
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,727
GUARD:
There's one! Get him!

1186
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:43,930
(SCOTT grunts)

1187
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:46,943
Jean!

1188
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:55,785
Jean.

1189
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,575
Jean?

1190
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,783
Jean, Jean.

1191
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,353
- Charles, what's wrong?
- I don't know. I can't read her mind.

1192
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,620
GUARD 1: Come on, out!
Take him out!

1193
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,875
Come on, out, out!
You guys, come on. Train.

1194
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,277
GUARD 2:
You four with me, let's go!

1195
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,404
- GUARD 1: Let's go!
- GUARD 2: Come on, move!

1196
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,884
GUARD 1: Come on.
Move, move, move!

1197
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,438
- She's alive.
- Scott, you have to get her out.

1198
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,810
You have to... No!

1199
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,855
(indistinct radio chatter)

1200
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,109
GUARD:
We're clear!

1201
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,839
(indistinct shouting below)

1202
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,545
GUARD:
Last one.

1203
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,232
We need a clean sweep
on the last three blocks.

1204
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,551
Let's go!

1205
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,682
(siren wailing)

1206
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,903
(train horn blares)

1207
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,906
My kid used to be a fan.

1208
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,247
Raven had the right of it.

1209
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,834
Jean was never the villain.

1210
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,301
I was.

1211
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,768
I should never have lied to her.

1212
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:50,439
I was wrong.

1213
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,903
But this power...

1214
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,565
inside of her,
I never put that there.

1215
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,618
I would never do anything
intentionally to hurt her.

1216
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,617
That isn't me
and this is not Jean.

1217
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,620
We can still save her.

1218
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,202
She's still Jean inside.

1219
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,010
PILOT: We're 10 miles out
from Mutant Containment Center.

1220
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,682
Prepare for prisoner transfer.

1221
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,362
What exactly is controlling her?

1222
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,563
I don't know.

1223
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,149
But this woman, this...

1224
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,484
thing...

1225
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,785
has had a taste of that power,

1226
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,099
and she'll be coming back for more.

1227
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,784
She'll be coming
back for Jean.

1228
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:50,081
Good. Let her.

1229
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,534
CHARLES:
She'll kill her to get it.

1230
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,416
But I promise you,
the killing will not end there.

1231
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,044
SCOTT: That's not what Raven
would have wanted.

1232
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,046
You know that.

1233
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,169
You both do.

1234
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,719
(rattling)

1235
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,765
GUNNER:
Skipper, are you seeing this?

1236
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,778
Alpha One, you have multiple
hostiles onboard.

1237
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,153
They're heading
towards the back.

1238
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,118
- Open four to five.
- GUARD: Copy that.

1239
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,540
All right, you two,
come with me.

1240
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,744
The rest of you, stay here,
guard the prisoners!

1241
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,250
Don't be fools!
You need our help!

1242
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,127
LEAD GUARD:
Lock it down! Now!

1243
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,797
Goddamn muties
come to spring you.

1244
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,424
They're not mutants.

1245
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,908
Free us, you're going
to need our help.

1246
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,638
We're the only chance you have.

1247
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,011
Keep your mouth shut.

1248
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,019
- (grunts)
- (electricity crackling)

1249
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,775
(grunting and screaming)

1250
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,288
- (man groans)
- PILOT: Mayday! Mayday!

1251
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,964
(engine sputtering)

1252
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,055
What's the status
on those mutants?

1253
