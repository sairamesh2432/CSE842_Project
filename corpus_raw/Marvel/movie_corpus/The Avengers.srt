You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

You talk about peace,

809
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:13,381
You have made me very desperate.

They're not of Asgard,

He means to lead them

826
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,403

Selvig?

832

839
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,510

00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,599

847
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,484

Keep love alive.

851
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,575
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

852
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,577
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

853
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:09,038
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

854
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,499
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

855
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,169
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

856
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,838
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

857
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,758
That man is playing Galaga.

858
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

859
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,557
How does Fury even see these?

<font color="#808080">HILL :</font>  He turns.

861
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,852

Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,752
The only major component
he still needs

865
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,362
is a power source
of high-energy density.

866
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,657
Something to kick-start the Cube.

<font color="#808080">HILL :</font>  When did you become an expert

00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,916
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

870
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,125
Am I the only one who did the reading?

871
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,086
<font color="#808080">ROGERS :</font> Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

872
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,048
<font color="#808080">BANNER :</font> He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

873
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,855
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

874

<font color="#808080">STARK :</font> Unless Selvig has figured out

00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,805
<font color="#808080">BANNER :</font> Well, if he could do that,

877
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,368
he could achieve heavy ion fusion

878
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,893
Finally, someone who speaks English.

879
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,937
<font color="#808080">ROGERS :</font> Is that what just happened?

<font color="#808080">STARK :</font> It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

881
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on antielectron

882
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,569
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

883
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,613
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

884
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,407

to track the Cube.

886
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,578
I was hoping you might join him.

887
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,746
<font color="#808080">ROGERS :</font>
I would start with that stick of his.

888
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,039
It may be magical,

889
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,582
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

890
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,585
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

891
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,712
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

892
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,589
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

893
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,424
into his personal flying monkeys.

894
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

895
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:46,386
I do.

896
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,099
I understood that reference.

897
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

898
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,436
This way, sir.

899
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,254
<font color="#808080">BANNER :</font> The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

900
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

901
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,373
But it's going to take weeks to process.

902
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,791
<font color="#808080">STARK :</font> If we bypass their mainframe

903
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,167
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

904
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,462
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

905
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,632

Top ten floors, all R&D.

908
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,306
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

909
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,058
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

910
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,811
I kind of broke Harlem.

Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

912
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,815

You really have got

What's your secret?

919
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:50,074
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,

Threatening the safety

923
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,955
isn't funny.

924
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,040
No offense, Doc.

925
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,803
<font color="#808080">ROGERS :</font> It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

927
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,172
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

928
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,215
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

931
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,555
What isn't he telling us?

932
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,182
I can't do the equation unless

He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

935
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,564
His secrets have secrets.

936
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,149
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

937
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:24,233

Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

I heard it.

943
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,418
I think that was meant for you.

944
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

945
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,662
it was still all over the news.

It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

950

953
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,235

on the Tesseract project?

954

956
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

1470
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,330
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1471
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,585
called the Avengers Initiative.

1472
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,922
The idea was to bring together a group

1473
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,591
of remarkable people

1474
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:32,178

something more.

01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:37,516
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1476
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,978
to fight the battles that we never could.

1477
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,861
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1479
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,500
