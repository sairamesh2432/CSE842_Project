slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

2196
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,611
And I heard a rumor.

2197
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:37,072
[♪♪♪]

2198
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,457
You know who he is.

2199
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,546
If I knew who he was...

2200
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,298
...he'd already be dead.

2201
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,715
Toomes, your family's here!

2202
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:01,137

2203
02:12:33,821 --> 02:12:36,665
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

2204
02:12:36,824 --> 02:12:40,795
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

2205
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,626
Patience.

2206
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:44,916
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

2207
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:47,130
Sometimes it leads to very little...

2208
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:49,637
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

2209
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,297
And you wonder...

2210
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:55,310
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

2211
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:01,015
How many more of these?
