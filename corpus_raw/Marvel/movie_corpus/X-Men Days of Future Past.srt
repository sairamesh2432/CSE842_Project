2
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:15,755
The future.

3
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,388
A dark desolate world.

4
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:31,077
World in war,
suffering, loss ..

5
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,484
.. on both sides.

6
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:39,065
Mutants and the humans who dared help them,

7
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:46,475
fighting an enemy we can not defeat.

8
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:16,213
Are we destined on this path?

9
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:21,749
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

10
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:30,159
or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?

11
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,342
Change our fate?

12
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:41,411
Is the future truly set?

13
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,253
They are here!

14
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:18,676
Time's-up !

15
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:19,782
Sentinel!

16
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:24,968
Sunspot.

17
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,007
Let's go!

18
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:01,601
Blink!

19
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:02,727
No!

20
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,103
It's too late, assholes !

21
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:12,828
<i>Come here!</i>

22
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,591
<i>Get your hands up!!</i>

23
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,946
<i>-Get down !!
-No!!!</i>

24
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:20,623
<i>No !!!</i>

25
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:28,179
So few of us left.

26
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:32,519
<i> Professor. </i>

27
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,233
We found them.

28
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,045
Professor.

29
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:11,927
-Bobby.
-Hi, Storm.

30
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:13,565
Hey, kid.

31
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:15,762
<i> Professor. </i>

32
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,063
You made it.

33
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,860
Whenever the Sentinels attack

34
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,288
Warpath spots them.

35
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:35,430
and I sent Bishop back to
warn us of the attack...

36
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,541
before it happens.

37
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,197
Blink scouts the next side and..

38
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,110
.. well then we leave before
they ever know we were there.

39
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,841
Because we never were.

40
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,880
What do you mean you've never  there?

41
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,535
She projects Bishop back in time few days...

42
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,583
to warn the others of the coming attack.

43
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,220
She sends Bishop back in time?

44
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,158
No, just his consciousness,
in to his younger-self

45
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:58,822
into his younger body.

46
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:00,183
Wow!

47
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,543
This not just work, Charles.

48
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:06,313
What might works?

49
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,240
The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Dr. Bolivar Trask.

50
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:16,605
In the early 70s he was one of the world leading weapons designers.

51
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:21,221
But, covertly he had began experimenting only mutants.

52
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:25,404
Using their gifts to fuel his own research.

53
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:29,476
There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.

54
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:34,831
Mutant with ability to
transform herself to anyone.

55
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:36,512
Mystique.

56
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,178
I knew her as  Raven.

57
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,676
We met when we were
children, grow up together.

58
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,943
She was like a sister to me.

59
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,909
I tried to help her.

60
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,712
But only succeeded in driving her away.

61
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:54,951
She hunted Trask across the world.

62
00:11:55,582 --> 00:12:00,712
And at the Paris Peace of Accords in 1973
after the Vietnam War.

63
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,668
<i> She found Trask, </i>

64
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:06,891
And killed him.

65
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:15,057
It was the first time she killed him.

66
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,112
Wasn't no last.

67
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:20,394
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

68
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:24,729
It only persuaded the government
the need for his program.

69
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,879
They captured her that day.

70
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,618
Tortured her and experimented on her.

71
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:35,719
In her DNA, they discovered the secret
to her power of transformation,

72
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,989
it gave them the key they needed,

73
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,052
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant's power.

74
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,245
And less than 50 years,

75
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:49,441
the machines were destroyed so
many of our kind were created.

76
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:54,047
and It all started that day in 1973,

77
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:56,516
The day she first  killed,

78
00:12:56,716 --> 00:12:59,905
<i> The day she truly became Mystique. </i>

79
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,278
Do you wanna go back there?

80
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,090
If I can get to her,

81
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:06,857
stop the assassination,

82
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,617
keep her out of their hands,

83
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:12,168
And we can stop the Sentinels
ever been borne.

84
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,238
And end this war,
before it  ever begins.

85
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,081
I can send someone back in couple of weeks.

86
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:27,184
Maybe a month, but you're talking about going back decades.

87
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,836
You have the most powerful brain the world, Professor.

88
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:34,091
<i> But the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps.</i>

89
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,186
<i>It will rip you apart.
I'm sorry. </i>

90
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,510
<i> No one can survive that trip. </i>

91
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,289
What if someone's mind has a
way of sniping back.

92
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,558
What if someone can heal as
faster as rip apart.

93
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:15,379
<i>Okay, Spread out. </i>

94
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,892
<i> Take you position.</i>

95
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,155
So I wake up in the my younger
body god knows where, then what?

96
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,572
You need to go to my house and find me,

97
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,541
convince me all of this.

98
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,263
Wouldn't you just be able to read my mind?

99
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:46,233
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

100
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:50,928
Logan, you have to do for me what I once did for you,

101
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,384
Lead me, guide me.

102
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,421
I was a very different man then.

103
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,467
You have to be patient with me.

104
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,554
Patience  isn't my strongest suit.

105
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,867
You're  need me as well.

106
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:04,684
What?

107
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,202
After Mystique left Charles, she came with me,

108
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,371
and I set her on a dangerous path.

109
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:12,105
Darker path.

110
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:17,325
It's going to take the two of us side by side
at a time when we couldn't be further apart.

111
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:22,134
Great.

112
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:24,607
So where do I find you?

113
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:26,551
Oh..Its complicated.

114
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,749
Basically, your body goes to sleep,
only your mind travels back in time.

115
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:37,517
As long as you back there, past and present
will continue to coexist.

116
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,392
But once you wake up....

117
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,386
.. whatever you've done will take hold and become history.

118
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,305
And for the rest of us that will
be the only history that we know.

119
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,333
That will be like,
last 50 years never happened.

120
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,803
This world, this war.

121
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,307
The only person who'll
remember it,

122
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,464
...is you.

123
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:03,676
Alright Logan, I need you to clear your
head and stay as calm as possible.

124
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:04,700
What do you mean?

125
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,744
If your mind gets rocky, It will harder for me to hold you.

126
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,838
You could start to slip between past and future.

127
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:11,961
What I need to get a little rocky ?

128
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,528
Think  peaceful thoughts.

129
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,007
Peaceful thoughts.

130
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,565
Do you have any good news?

131
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:18,269
Well,

132
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,904
You don't really age so you'll
pretty much look the same.

133
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,388
You don't have much time in past.

134
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,375
Sentinels will find
us, they always do.

135
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:31,111
And this time we won't
be able to run or have no escape.

136
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:33,913
This is our last chance.

137
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,798
Do you really think this will work?

138
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,578
I have faith in him.

139
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:41,437
So do him right about his choice.

140
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,132
If he is young, It would
be no any better.

141
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,143
We'll know.

142
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,389
See you soon.

143
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,639
It might sting a little.

144
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:30,382
Holy Shit !!

145
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,570
It worked.

146
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,321
Hey, what's going on ?

147
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,319
-Gwen! Get dressed!
-Who are you?

148
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,599
Hey, I don't know what's going on.

149
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,835
What's going on is you supposed to guard
your Boss's daughter, not screwing her.

150
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:53,728
I didn't sleep with her.

151
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:55,086
-No?
-No.

152
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:58,836
I mean, yes
I slept with her many times, but...

153
00:18:58,876 --> 00:18:59,594
Jimmy!

154
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,991
That wasn't me. That was old me.

155
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,778
-I just got here like 20 seconds ago.
-Really?

156
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:07,394
-Yeah.
-What happen to your cloths?

157
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,634
No...Oh..

158
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:12,787
Will you believe me if I told you
I've sent here from the future?

159
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:16,733
-Get out of here, Sweetheart.
-Yeah

160
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,089
We'll take care of this comedian.

161
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,778
No you not.

162
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,032
You gonna give me the keys of your car  and money for gas

163
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,689
or you gonna wake up in a hospital.

164
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,389
Trust me, I know how these things pay out.

165
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,802
-Because you from the future?
-No,

166
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,304
...because of these.

167
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,291
What the hell!!

168
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,075
Ahhh...Damn it.

169
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:00,888
Peaceful thoughts.

170
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,632
<i> We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures</i>

171
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,812
<i> and all the black books are being opened. </i>

172
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,615
<i> We can't support a weapon that
targets our own citizens </i>

173
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:28,026
If these mutants as you described,

174
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:31,895
Already living among us,
then they are living here peacefully.

175
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,347
- We haven't had an incident in over 10 years.
-After what happened in cuba?

176
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:36,778
It was never confirmed.

177
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:39,064
We have real enemies out there.

178
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,746
Russians, The Chinese.

179
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,751
We're talking about 10 of 10 of the 10
of our population.

180
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:49,417
-Allow me to read something to you.
-Please.

181
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:52,653
This was acquired by our
friends at the CIA.

182
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:53,971
Its in a dissertation,

183
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:57,638
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

184
00:20:58,754 --> 00:20:59,521
And I quote.

185
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:04,915
<i>To Homo-neanderthals his a
mutant cousin of Homo Saphiens,</i>

186
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:06,403
<i>Which is us.</i>

187
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,086
Was an aberration,

188
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:12,161
the arrival of mutated human
species: Homo Saphiens.

189
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:16,379
was followed by the immediate extinction
of the their less evolve kin.

190
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:17,607
Well,

191
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:19,693
Now..

192
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,819
We are the <i> Neanderthals.</i>

193
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,082
Speak for  yourself,  Dr.. Trask.

194
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:31,947
<i> You know when you send our soldiers to Vietnam without the weapon they needed to win the war</i>

195
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,958
<i> you underestimated your enemy. </i>

196
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,494
You, hah you do that with this enemy,

197
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:41,664
It won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

198
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,547
<i> This time the war will be for our
streets, our cities, our homes.</i>

199
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,461
And by the time you see
the need for my program,

200
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,184
it will be too late.

201
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,980
And you will have lost two
wars in one life time.

202
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,608
We're sorry, Dr.. Trask.

203
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:05,132
But your Sentinel Program,

204
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,530
It ain't gonna fly.

205
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,797
Can I help you, Colonel?

206
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,657
Just here to give my
boys to proper send off.

207
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:28,089
I'm sorry, sir. But we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

208
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:30,993
Stand a side, soldier.
That's an order.

209
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:42,831
Attention.

210
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,921
At ease.

211
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:09,348
What is all this?

212
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:12,825
Lab reports, blood tests. All are
getting packed up and send back.

213
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:14,107
Where is it going?

214
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:15,507
Same place as they are.

215
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,117
Trask Industries.

216
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,339
Lets go gentleman

217
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,138
Taking you out of this shit show.

218
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:24,139
Shipping home?

219
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:26,893
Not just yet.

220
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:29,383
What do you doing with those?

221
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,080
Its only make the ride little smoother.

222
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:34,011
We are transferring you to a
private facility, where we can..

223
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,433
run a few more tests.

224
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:42,968
Your men are not military.

225
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,899
Private outfit.
We're authorized to command these men.

226
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:53,577
These troops are going home.

227
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,059
Well, colonel...

228
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,386
I don't believe you have the
jurisdiction in this matter.

229
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:00,583
I'm afraid I do it, son.

230
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:03,036
I'm sorry who are you?

231
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:04,998
The question is, Major.

232
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:10,304
Who are you?

233
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:56,732
Raven.

234
00:24:57,428 --> 00:24:58,641
That's not my name.

235
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:07,220
-I had him.
-I know.

236
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,009
Let's move out.
Com-on let's go.

237
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:12,616
Where's Erik?

238
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,171
I'm on my own now.

239
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:18,353
Let's go. Move it.

240
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,385
Hold that plane!

241
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,264
I wanna leave these boys in this
godforsaken country

242
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:42,140
Let's go.

243
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,737
You're not coming with us, are you?

244
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:48,495
My war is not over.
The enemy is still out there.

245
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:12,559
Where did they go?

246
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,995
Four cadets where they go?

247
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,412
They went over there.

248
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:40,579
PRIVATE PROPERTY
KEEP OUT

249
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:46,581
XAVIER'S SCHOOL

250
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:15,759
Can I help you?

251
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,502
Ahh Yeah what happened to the School?

252
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:20,613
School has been shut for years.

253
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,027
Are you a parent?

254
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:23,613
Sure as hell hope not.

255
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,942
-Who are you?
-I'm Hank.

256
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,186
I and Maccoy,  look
after the house now.

257
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:30,890
You are Beast?

258
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:33,604
Look at you, guess you are a late bloomer.

259
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:36,917
I do not know what you're talking about.
I'm  gonna have to ask you to leave.

260
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,957
-Where is the professor?
-There is no professor here.

261
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:41,897
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

262
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:44,787
Sure there is no Beast thing  here?

263
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:46,345
-Come on, Beast.
-Beast is not here.

264
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:47,532
-Come on, Beasty.
-Go!

265
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:49,892
Hey!!

266
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:53,236
I said, the school is closed.
You need to leave.

267
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:54,682
Not until I see the professor.

268
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,867
There is no professor here.
I told you that.

269
00:27:57,334 --> 00:28:01,054
Look, kid.
You and I gonna be good friends.

270
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,249
You just don't know what yet.

271
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:08,494
Professor!

272
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:10,760
Ahhh.....

273
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:16,446
Professor!

274
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,627
Hank, what's going on here?

275
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,981
-Professor.
-Please do not call me that.

276
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:40,646
Do you know this guy?

277
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,186
Yeah he looks slightly familiar

278
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:44,975
Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.

279
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:48,268
You can walk.

280
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:49,788
You're a perceptive one.

281
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,814
I thought Erik ..

282
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:54,135
What you saying managed to
miss our sign on the way in

283
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:58,357
This is private property my friend, i'm
gonna ask him to ask you to leave.

284
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,428
Well, I'm afraid I can't do that because...

285
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,754
..because I was sent here for you

286
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,444
Well, tell whoever it was that sent you that I'm busy.

287
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,918
This gonna be a little tricky,
because the person who sent me..

288
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,160
was you.

289
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,497
-What?
-About 50 years from now.

290
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,550
50 years from now, like in the
future 50 years from now.

291
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:20,831
Yeah.

292
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:22,728
-I sent you from the future.
-Yeah.

293
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,194
Piss off.

294
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,969
If you had your powers,
you know I was telling the truth.

295
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:30,066
How do you know I don't have my.....

296
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:32,982
-Who are you?
-I told you.

297
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,568
-You are CIA?
-No.

298
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,533
You were watching me.

299
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,612
I know you, Charles.

300
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,021
We've been friends  for years.

301
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:41,990
I know your powers came when you were 9.

302
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,795
I know you thought, you were going crazy when
it started, all the voices in your head.

303
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:51,195
and it wasn't until you were 12 that you realized
all the voices were in everyone else's head.

304
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,133
Do you want me to go on?

305
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:56,763
I never told that anyone.

306
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,798
Not yet no but, you'll.

307
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:04,290
Alright you've picked my
interest, what do you want?

308
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:07,026
We have to stop Raven.

309
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:11,065
I need your help.

310
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:13,650
We need your help.

311
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,670
Think I'd like to wake up now.

312
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,637
What does she have to do with this?

313
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,189
So, you're saying that they
took raven's power and what?

314
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,452
They weaponized it?

315
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:39,444
Yep

316
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,660
She is unique.

317
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,436
Yes, she is.

318
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,265
In the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

319
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:50,177
Then they began to identify
the genetics in non-mutants.

320
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:54,949
Who would eventually have mutant
children or grandchildren

321
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,277
Many of the humans tried to help us,
it was a slaughter

322
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,961
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge

323
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:03,392
But then it went worse.

324
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,264
I've never seen anything like this.

325
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:10,024
And it all starts with her.

326
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:13,082
Let's just say that for the sake of,

327
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:17,264
Sake that I choose to believe
you, that I choose to help you.

328
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,218
Raven won't listen to me.

329
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:25,092
No her heart and soul belongs
to someone else now.

330
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:26,629
I know.

331
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,667
That's why we gonna need Magneto, too.

332
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:32,685
Erik?

333
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,158
You do know where he is?

334
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah.

335
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,659
He's where he belongs.

336
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:46,228
So that's it, you're just gonna walk out?

337
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:48,807
Oh top marks, like I said,
you are perceptive.

338
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,838
The professor I know would
never turn his back

339
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,356
..on someone who lost their path

340
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:54,533
Especially someone he loved.

341
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:58,412
You know..

342
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,675
I think I do remember you now.

343
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:04,902
Yeah, we came to you a long
time ago seeking your help.

344
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:08,918
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then,

345
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,627
Fuck off!

346
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:16,246
Listen to me you little
shit, I've come a long way,

347
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:18,896
and I watched a lot of people die,
good people, friends.

348
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:22,452
if you're gonna wallow in
self pity and do nothing,

349
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:24,772
Then you're gonna watch the
same thing, you understand?

350
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:31,648
We all have to die some time.

351
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,996
I told you, there is
no professor here.

352
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,096
What the hell happened to him?

353
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:53,020
<i> He lost everything.
Erik, Raven, his legs. </i>

354
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:57,253
The school allowed us this whole place

355
00:32:57,806 --> 00:32:59,656
Just after the first semester,

356
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,431
The war
in Vietnam got worse.

357
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:07,117
Many of the teachers and
students were drafted.

358
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,128
It really broke him.

359
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,641
<i> He retreated into himself.. </i>

360
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,426
<i>I wanted to help do something so.. </i>

361
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,713
<i> So I designed a serum to
treat his spine, </i>

362
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:21,133
<i> Derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation. </i>

363
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,838
I take just enough to
keep myself balanced but,

364
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,933
he takes too much.

365
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:32,263
I tried easing him back but he
just couldn't bear the pain

366
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:33,597
Voices..

367
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,734
The treatment gives
him him his legs but

368
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:38,747
It's not enough

369
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:40,570
He's..

370
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,101
He's just lost too much.

371
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,942
<i> You're not scare to me? </i>

372
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:04,464
<i>I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.</i>

373
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,376
<i> Charles Xavier. </i>

374
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:09,993
Raven .

375
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,969
You're hungry and alone?

376
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,408
Take whatever you want.

377
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,759
We got lots of food, you
don't have to steal. .

378
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:22,784
In-fact, you never have to steal again.

379
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,492
<i>And that's a promise. </i>

380
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,483
I hope you get her.

381
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:38,027
but not for any of your
future shots but for her .

382
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:39,081
Fare enough.

383
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,917
I'm telling you this, you do not know Erik.

384
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:45,418
The man is a monster.
A murderer.

385
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:48,230
You think you can convince Raven to change?

386
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,522
To come home?

387
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,140
Splendid.

388
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:55,236
But what makes you think
you can change the him?

389
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,173
Because you and Erik
sent me here back together.

390
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:06,249
The room they're holding him in was built during the
2nd world war when there was a shortage of steel

391
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,924
So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand, no metal.

392
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,716
And he's being held a 100
floors beneath the most,

393
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:16,205
Heavily guarded building on the planet.

394
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:17,357
Why is he in there?

395
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:20,713
What, he forgot to mention?

396
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:23,751
Ahhh JFK.

397
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:25,495
He  killed him?

398
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:29,820
What else would explain the bullet
miraculously curving through the air,

399
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,739
Eric's always had a way with guns.

400
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,891
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

401
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,491
This is your plan, not mine.

402
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,473
We don't have any resources to get us in,
or out

403
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,099
It's just me and Hank.

404
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:42,599
I know a guy.

405
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:45,832
Yeah, he'd be a young man now
grew up outside of DC

406
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,604
He could get into anywhere,

407
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,915
just don't know how the
hell we're gonna find him

408
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:55,916
History provided the question

409
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,092
We have a phone book

410
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:09,667
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip, sir.

411
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,832
I just came to grab couple of files.

412
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,417
Is that a new scarf?

413
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,267
It's nice.

414
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:16,627
Thank you.

415
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,003
AUTOPSY REPORTS

416
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,414
Dr. Trask.

417
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:50,375
One second.

418
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:54,987
We added some names to the Paris meeting

419
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,560
Thank you.

420
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,850
Is there something wrong, sir?

421
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:04,296
No.

422
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:05,725
It's nothing.

423
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:08,101
Would you mind typing up my itinerary.

424
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,395
I don't wanna miss anything.

425
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:43,851
What has he done now?

426
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:46,748
-I'll just write you a check for whatever he took.
-We just need talk to him.

427
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,423
Peter, the cops are here..

428
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,693
.. again.

429
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:03,322
Guess what, I didn't do anything

430
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:04,244
I've been here all day.

431
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:07,985
Just relax Peter, we are not  cops.

432
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,226
Of course you're not cops, if you were
cops you wouldn't drive a rental car

433
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:11,625
How'd you know we got a rental car?

434
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:13,372
I checked your registration when you
were walking through the door,

435
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,544
I also had some time to kill so I went through your
rental agreements, saw you were from out of town

436
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:17,830
Are you FBI?

437
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:21,931
No, you're not cops, hey what's
up with this kid's school place

438
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,238
That's an old card.

439
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:25,692
He is fascinating

440
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:26,742
He is a pain in the ass.

441
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:27,728
What teleporter?

442
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:29,065
No, He's just fast.

443
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:32,115
When I know him he was
so old. Young.

444
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,023
Young?
You're just old.

445
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:37,029
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

446
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,114
Power? What power? What
you talking about?

447
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,124
You see some strange here?

448
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,803
Nothing anybody believe if you told them.

449
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,923
So who are you?
What do you want?

450
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,257
We need your help, Peter.

451
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,955
What?

452
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:54,778
Break into a highly secured facility

453
00:39:54,846 --> 00:39:56,015
and get someone out.

454
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:56,898
Prison break?

455
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:59,715
That's illegal, you know.

456
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:04,716
Well, only if you get caught.

457
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,250
What's there in for me?

458
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:09,794
You, the kleptomaniac, get
to break into the pentagon.

459
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,156
How do I know I can trust you?

460
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:19,741
Because we are just like you.

461
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:23,183
Show him.

462
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:36,509
It's cool, just disgusting

463
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:43,236
Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the
world largest office building.

464
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:48,436
Housing more than 25000 military and police
stretched over 6 million square feet.

465
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:52,217
Where  is the bathroom?
<i>I need to pee. </i>

466
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,049
Well, lucky for you, you have...

467
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,299
Thank you.

468
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,855
No Metal Beyond This Point.

469
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,031
Yeah, we getting broadcast signal down here?
What's going on?

470
00:41:58,093 --> 00:41:59,718
Damn it !! Call the maintenance,
get them down here.

471
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,443
MIND THE GLASS

472
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,749
<i>....from a Japanese empire.</i>

473
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:42,677
<i>This month long battle...</i>

474
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,050
<i>included some of the fearsome
fighting during world war II</i>

475
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:03,974
In 3 seconds those doors are going to open,

476
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:06,675
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

477
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:09,262
I know, that's what i'm waiting for

478
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,489
What are you doing?

479
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,437
I'm holding your neck so
you won't get whip-lash

480
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:13,139
What?

481
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,970
Whip.....la..sh

482
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:21,272
They're in.

483
00:44:36,446 --> 00:44:37,972
You're good. It'll pass.

484
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:39,871
It happens when I run.

485
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,074
Must have done something pretty serious.

486
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:46,361
What're you do, man?
What you do.

487
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:48,861
What're you do?
Why would they have you in there.

488
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:49,996
For killing the president.

489
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:58,673
Anything i'm guilty of is fighting
for people like us

490
00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:00,888
You take Karate?
You're a Karate man?

491
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,582
I don't know Karate.

492
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:04,245
I know crazy.

493
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:08,686
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
this is a code red situation

494
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:14,155
We are evacuating the entire floor so that we,
my uh associate and I can uh

495
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:15,492
- Secure the prisoner.
- Who are you?

496
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:20,382
We are special operations
CB, FE, CIED look,

497
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:22,493
Perhaps you didn't hear
me what first I spoke

498
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,996
It's imperative that you understand
we're in complete lock down situation.

499
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,764
We have to get in to the 3rd floor

500
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:36,597
Oh, I'm sorry, you want to finish?

501
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:43,867
They told me you can control the metal.

502
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:44,923
They?

503
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,443
You know my mom once knew a
guy who could do that.

504
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:57,140
Sorry, I'm just not very
good with violence.

505
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:01,004
Charles.

506
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,925
Good to see you too, old friend.

507
00:46:09,992 --> 00:46:12,677
-And walking?
-Not thanks to you.

508
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:17,151
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

509
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,502
Believe me, I wouldn’t
be here if I didn't have to.

510
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,749
If we get you out of here we do it my way,

511
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:23,845
No killing.

512
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:24,934
No helmet.

513
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:27,557
I couldn't disobey you even if I want to.

514
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,472
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

515
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:33,551
I need your word, Erik.

516
00:46:37,147 --> 00:46:38,283
No body move!

517
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:40,257
Move it, right there!

518
00:46:42,697 --> 00:46:43,815
Charles.
<i> Don't move! </i>

519
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:46,884
Hands up or we'll shoot!

520
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:48,213
-Freeze them, Charles.
-I can't.

521
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:49,163
Hands up!

522
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:54,975
No!

523
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:12,806
<font color=#ffff00>♪ If I could save time in bottle....</font>

524
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:17,593

525
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:25,368

00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:45,325

530
00:47:45,756 --> 00:47:49,710
<font color=#ffff00>♪ Again, I would spend them with you..</font>

531
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:53,907
<font color=#ffff00>♪ But there never seems to be enough time..</font>

532
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:58,199
<font color=#ffff00>♪ To do the things you want to do once you find them..</font>

533
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,808
<font color=#ffff00>♪ I've looked around enough to know..</font>

534
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:08,599
<font color=#ffff00>♪ That you're the one I want to go through time with..</font>

535
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:49,606
Thanks kid.

536
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:57,019
Peter, thank you very very much.

537
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,274
You take care.

538
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,488
Yeah, safe flight man, *****,
why you want to go Paris?

539
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,852
Imagine if they made of metal.

540
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,259
Do me a favor and return it for me, okay.

541
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:18,167
Peter...

542
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,137
Take it slowly.

543
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:22,989
Where did they dig you up?

544
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:27,421
You're gonna find this
hard to believe, but ahh..

545
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:29,440
You sent me.

546
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,755
You and Charles,

547
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:33,590
from the future.

548
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,575
How did you lose them?

549
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:01,084
The treatment for my spine fixed my DNA.

550
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,058
You sacrificed your powers
that you could walk?

551
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:09,500
I sacrificed my power so that I could st..

552
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:13,943
What do you know about it?

553
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,061
I lost my fair share, hah.

554
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,314
Dry your eyes, Erik.

555
00:50:18,943 --> 00:50:20,460
It doesn't justify what you've done.

556
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:22,311
You've no idea what I have done.

557
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,452
I know that you took the
things that mean most to me.

558
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,651
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

559
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:30,066
Do you want to fight, Erik?
I'll give you a fight !!

560
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:32,433
-Let him come.
-You abandoned me!

561
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:35,200
You took her away and you abandoned me!

562
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:36,081
Angel.

563
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,699
Azazel.

564
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:39,697
Emma.

565
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:41,437
Banshee.

566
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,552
Mutant brothers and sisters all dead!

567
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,601
Congress on this

568
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:52,597
..experimented on, butchered

569
00:50:52,797 --> 00:50:53,384
Erik.

570
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:54,678
Where were you, Charles?

571
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:57,379
We were supposed to protect them!

572
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:00,476
Where were you your own people needed you?

573
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:01,656
Hiding!

574
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:05,174
You and Hank, pretending you
were something you're not

575
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,446
Erik.

576
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:11,246
You abandon us all.

577
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:32,919
So you were always an asshole

578
00:51:36,031 --> 00:51:38,670
I take it we're best buddies in the future

579
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:43,457
I spent a lot of years trying
to bring you down, bub

580
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,634
How is that work out for you?

581
00:51:45,967 --> 00:51:47,354
You're like me.

582
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,983
You're a survivor.

583
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,837
You wanna pick all that shit up?

584
00:51:58,558 --> 00:52:00,391
Paris

585
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,332
<i>General, maybe you should go slowly,
we have a long day tomorrow.</i>

586
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,926
<i>We are celebrating,
captain.</i>

587
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:24,041
<i>It's not every day
that we win a war</i>

588
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:26,324
<i>Much less against
the damn Americans</i>

589
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:29,525
<i>I'll get another bottle.</i>

590
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:51,402
<i>- My apologies.
- I assure you it was my fault.</i>

591
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:54,388
<i>- Do you speak Vietnamese.
- I'm a performer.</i>

592
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:58,884
<i>I speak many languages.</i>

593
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,554
<i>Let me buy you another drink,</i>

594
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,075
<i>unless you are
accompanied.</i>

595
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:07,166
<i>i'm alone.</i>

596
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,781
<i>A bottle of Johnnie Walker,
Please.</i>

597
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:28,270
<i>You go to the Dome tomorrow?</i>

598
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:38,240
<i>A beautiful girl
interested in politics ...</i>

599
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:40,879
<i>Appearances can be deceiving.</i>

600
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,288
Wanna play a game? It's been a while.

601
00:54:57,387 --> 00:54:58,941
I'm not in emotion for a game.

602
00:55:05,908 --> 00:55:08,237
Haven't had a real sip in 10 years.

603
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:22,964
I didn't kill the president.

604
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,768
Bullet curved, Erik.

605
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:27,941
Because I was trying to save him.

606
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:30,966
They took me out before I could.

607
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:33,514
-Why would you trying to save him?
-Because he was one of us.

608
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:48,182
You must think me so foolish.

609
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:52,020
We always said they would come after us.

610
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:54,966
I never imagined they would
use Raven's DNA to do it.

611
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:58,111
When did you last see her?

612
00:56:01,301 --> 00:56:02,731
The day I left to Dallas.

613
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:05,201
And how is she?

614
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:08,394
Strong.

615
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:10,350
Driven

616
00:56:11,771 --> 00:56:13,017
-Loyal.
-How..

617
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:14,971
How was she?

618
00:56:17,016 --> 00:56:18,449
She was..

619
00:56:25,024 --> 00:56:27,669
I could see why she had so much talent.

620
00:56:30,676 --> 00:56:31,991
You should be proud of her, Charles.

621
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,471
She is out there fighting for our cause.

622
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:36,654
Your cause.

623
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:40,386
The girl I knew, she was
not capable of killing.

624
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:42,387
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

625
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:44,720
She couldn't stay a little girl forever
that's why she left

626
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:48,157
She left because you got inside her head

627
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:50,887
That's not my power.

628
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:54,850
She made a choice.

629
00:56:54,888 --> 00:56:57,541
But now we know where that
choice leads, don't we?

630
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,868
She's going to murder trask,
they're going to capture her,

631
00:57:00,995 --> 00:57:03,055
and then they're going to wipe us out.

632
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,574
Not if we get to her first.

633
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,832
Not if we change history tomorrow.

634
00:57:14,455 --> 00:57:15,547
I'm sorry, Charles.

635
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,546
For what happened, I truly am

636
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,158
It's been a while since I played

637
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:33,791
I'll go easy on you.

638
00:57:35,738 --> 00:57:36,966
Might finally get a fair fight.

639
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,721
You make the first move.

640
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:57,854
The diplomats from all around the
world arriving here today at the

641
00:57:57,888 --> 00:57:59,625
<i> hotel Royale.</i>

642
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:02,881
<i> It's a historic day as the official ending of, </i>

643
00:58:02,904 --> 00:58:05,560
<i> the united states fierce
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

644
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:10,269
There's the south Vietnamese foreign minister
with other south vietnamese dignitaries

645
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:13,158
The summit doesn't begin for another hour

646
00:58:13,504 --> 00:58:16,767
The hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for you, special quest

647
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:17,923
That'll be fine.

648
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:25,249
Good afternoon, everyone, hello.

649
00:58:25,317 --> 00:58:26,472
Thank you for coming.

650
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:30,118
Congratulations on winning this war.

651
00:58:30,193 --> 00:58:34,491
Now I know you all have hands to
shake and photos to take downstairs,

652
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:36,242
So I will get right to the point.

653
00:58:37,738 --> 00:58:39,831
There is a new enemy out there.

654
00:58:40,612 --> 00:58:43,026
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless,

655
00:58:43,112 --> 00:58:46,378
Your armies powerless and
your nations defenseless.

656
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,152
<i> You'll need a new weapon for this war.</i>

657
00:58:54,455 --> 00:58:56,321
<i> I call them "Sentinels". </i>

658
00:58:58,226 --> 00:59:02,559
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

659
00:59:04,266 --> 00:59:07,148
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a Harrier Jet.

660
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:10,034
Armed with guns that can fire off,

661
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:14,091
<i> more than 2000 rounds per minute with
thermo-ceramic ammunition.</i>

662
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,314
But size, power, speed,

663
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:19,480
<i> You can find that at Lockheed above. </i>

664
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:22,289
<i> No, what makes the
sentinels so special?</i>

665
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,435
<i> Is the ability to target
the mutant X gene? </i>

666
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,452
The genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark half a mile away.

667
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:33,878
And won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

668
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:36,693
With this weapon there'll be
no human collateral damage.

669
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,842
If I turn it on the system
couldn't even activate in here.

670
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:48,575
<i> Unless... </i>

671
00:59:49,507 --> 00:59:51,467
...there's a mutant.

672
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,807
There has to be some kind of mistake.

673
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,276
My machine don't make mistakes.

674
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:10,813
What are you?

675
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:13,313
I assure you

676
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:16,203
I ..

677
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,136
No.Don't shoot him.

678
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:18,677
<i> I assure you. </i>

679
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,406
Do not arrest him.

680
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
I do not know what  you're talking about.

681
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:55,906
<i> Raven! </i>

682
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:02,153
Raven.

683
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:02,606
Raven.

684
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:03,708
Raven!

685
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:08,262
Raven.

686
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:11,824
Charles.

687
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,314
We've come for you.
Erik and I.

688
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:15,866
Together.

689
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:18,770
<i>I never thought I could
see you again. </i>

690
01:01:19,232 --> 01:01:22,412
<i>I made you a promise long time
ago that I would protect you.</i>

691
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,265
<i>I didn't. And I know...</i>

692
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:31,523
<i> Wolverine! </i>

693
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,200
I'm going to keep you safe
I'm going to keep you out of their hands

694
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:43,106
Erik.

695
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:45,824
Erik.

696
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:47,461
What are you doing?

697
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:50,379
Securing our future.

698
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:51,899
Forgive me, Mystique.

699
01:01:52,865 --> 01:01:55,482
Ss long as you're out there
we'll never be safe.

700
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:57,920
Erik.

701
01:01:57,971 --> 01:01:59,962
Use your powers, Charles.
Stop him.

702
01:02:00,168 --> 01:02:00,877
He can't.

703
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,482
He is slipping.
He is slipping back.

704
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:34,832
<i>I'm loosing him.</i>

705
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:17,454
<i> Striker! </i>

706
01:03:17,805 --> 01:03:20,490
<i> This is where you started
as Wolverine, okay? </i>

707
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:23,006
<i>  Kitty! </i>

708
01:03:26,745 --> 01:03:27,259
Restrain him.

709
01:03:42,868 --> 01:03:43,443
Erik!

710
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,028
Where am I?

711
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:55,628
Ahh.

712
01:03:58,094 --> 01:03:59,365
How the hell did I get here?

713
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,003
What?
You came to us.

714
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,533
-Who are you?
-Charles.

715
01:04:03,627 --> 01:04:04,891
Charles Xavier.

716
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:06,624
-I do not know you.
-Ahh?

717
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:08,193
What the hell is that?

718
01:04:09,056 --> 01:04:10,815
Wow, ho I can deal with this.

719
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:12,669
Just go.
Stop, Erik.

720
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:14,276
Erik.

721
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:16,070
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:16,897
Erik.

723
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,037
You are Logan.
That's Hank McCoy.

724
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,963
I'm Charles Xavier.

725
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:40,967
You spent the last couple of days with us.

726
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,780
You're on Acid?

727
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:49,650
Somebody gave you really bad acid.

728
01:04:50,564 --> 01:04:51,290
Yeah?

729
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,909
Just hold on tight we'll
get through this together.

730
01:05:39,843 --> 01:05:41,462
-Oh, God !
- Kitty.

731
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,647
She is wounded pretty bad.

732
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:50,609
I got him.

733
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,203
Professor.

734
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:58,124
What happened to you?

735
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:02,045
I just saw someone who's going to
bring me a lot of pain someday.

736
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,328
Where is Raven?

737
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:07,448
Gone.

738
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,400
-What?
-We have to get out of here.

739
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:23,934
Yesterday the paris peace summit was rocked
by the appearance of unidentified assailants.

740
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,102
<i> The likes of which the
world has never seen.</i>

741
01:07:26,425 --> 01:07:28,967
<i> Mass hysteria has gripped the
nation as people ask, </i>

742
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:31,453
<i> Where did they come from?
Will they'd be back? </i>

743
01:07:31,683 --> 01:07:32,910
<i> And  most importantly, </i>

744
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,032
<i> Are they friend or foe? </i>

745
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:38,985
<i>That was one in corresponding to the earlier
reporting from the Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

746
01:07:40,963 --> 01:07:42,111
What the hell are we dealing with here?

747
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:43,970
Off the record.

748
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:45,510
Two days ago,

749
01:07:45,658 --> 01:07:50,642
This man Erick Lehnsherr escaped from a
maximum security prison inside the Pentagon.

750
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:54,264
<i> We believe that this woman is a
former associate of lehnsherr's. </i>

751
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:57,828
They were together in cuba
the day of the crisis in 1962.

752
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:01,484
Hs was also linked to the
Kennedy assassination.

753
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:04,310
What about that thing?

754
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,139
We do not know what that thing is, Sir.

755
01:08:06,442 --> 01:08:08,502
Actually we really don't
know what any of them are.

756
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:09,485
Yes.

757
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,795
Yes, We do.

758
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:13,203
They are mutants.

759
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:18,457
He ​​has the power to control metal.

760
01:08:19,157 --> 01:08:21,860
Last I checked that's what most
of your weapons were made of.

761
01:08:22,284 --> 01:08:25,669
And she can transform into anyone.

762
01:08:26,113 --> 01:08:27,145
A general.

763
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:28,481
A secret service man.

764
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:30,384
Even you, Mr. President.

765
01:08:31,088 --> 01:08:33,840
She can walk into this office,
and order a nuclear strike,

766
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:35,522
if she was in the mood.

767
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,776
And that's only two of them.

768
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,601
Well, do we have any
countermeasures, any defense?

769
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,356
I was waiting for you to
ask me that question.

770
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:47,505
That's an experimental program, Sir.
Strictly off the books.

771
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:59,113
You're telling me these
mutants are out in the world,

772
01:08:59,212 --> 01:09:01,803
And our best defense are
these giant metal robots?

773
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,997
Many of the mutants looks like us.

774
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,374
My sentinels can tell the difference.

775
01:09:06,866 --> 01:09:08,891
I have 8 prototypes ready to go,

776
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:13,006
They're built out of a space
age polymer, not an ounce of metal on them.

777
01:09:19,498 --> 01:09:20,869
I wanna make a demonstration,

778
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,440
I want the world
to know that we can protect them.

779
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:25,289
What do you need to get
these things operational?

780
01:09:25,382 --> 01:09:26,930
I already gave that number to congress

781
01:09:27,278 --> 01:09:29,729
Unfortunately they elected to shut me down.

782
01:09:30,043 --> 01:09:32,700
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

783
01:09:32,938 --> 01:09:33,555
Whatever you need.

784
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:37,085
Oh, and one more thing, if we
do manage to capture them,

785
01:09:37,517 --> 01:09:41,406
I would like her for
research purposes of course.

786
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,348
Horrible.

787
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,273
What is it?

788
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:52,963
He was born like that.

789
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:54,155
Like that?

790
01:09:54,922 --> 01:09:57,049
Just imagine ..

791
01:09:57,415 --> 01:09:59,359
Reflecting and see the ugly face like that?

792
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:01,860
I can imagine.

793
01:10:06,087 --> 01:10:07,845
Where did she come from?

794
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:10,215
Does she has a family?

795
01:10:13,522 --> 01:10:16,249
Yes, she does.

796
01:11:04,438 --> 01:11:08,431
If I see so much as a screw
I'll jam this into your throat.

797
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:10,899
How did you find me?

798
01:11:11,346 --> 01:11:12,369
You taught me well.

799
01:11:13,053 --> 01:11:15,112
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

800
01:11:16,587 --> 01:11:17,828
I miss you.

801
01:11:18,455 --> 01:11:19,513
You tried to kill me.

802
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,663
So the rest of us could live.

803
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:24,983
What do you mean?

804
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,615
I received a message from the future.

805
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,446
Don't lie to me.

806
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,072
I never have, I never will.

807
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:38,415
Humans use your blood, your genes to
create a weapon that wipes us all out.

808
01:11:39,201 --> 01:11:42,197
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

809
01:11:42,337 --> 01:11:45,509
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

810
01:11:46,978 --> 01:11:47,676
Nothing.

811
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,637
It doesn't matter anymore.

812
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:54,082
They have your DNA, your
blood was on the street.

813
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:56,181
Whose fault is that?

814
01:11:57,892 --> 01:11:58,601
Mine.

815
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:01,751
I've seen their plans.

816
01:12:02,257 --> 01:12:03,684
They are creating a weapon,

817
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:07,162
And now they have what they
need to take it further.

818
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:12,375
We have to strike now, while we have a
chance, while we still hold the upper hand.

819
01:12:15,222 --> 01:12:16,992
I've seen too many friends die, Eric.

820
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:20,900
I don't want a war.

821
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:23,667
I only want the man who murdered them.

822
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:24,770
This is a war.

823
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,048
What happened to you?

824
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:32,089
Did you lose your way
when I was gone?

825
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:35,937
Are you still Charles’s' Raven?

826
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:40,206
Or are you Mystique?

827
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,210
Trask is the enemy.

828
01:12:47,515 --> 01:12:49,574
Killing one man isn't enough.

829
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:51,361
It never was for you.

830
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,704
Good Bye, Erik.

831
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:20,513
What happened?

832
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,323
Can he walk?

833
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:23,485
He need his treatment.

834
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:25,494
Hank, I can hear them.

835
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,038
It's ok, I'll make it stop. I'll get it

836
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:32,462
Hey, Hey. Pull yourself together

837
01:13:33,048 --> 01:13:34,251
It's not over yet.

838
01:13:38,157 --> 01:13:40,057
You don’t believe that?

839
01:13:41,571 --> 01:13:42,538
How do you know?

840
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:43,771
As these go,

841
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:49,018
This coming back.

842
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:52,283
They all come back.

843
01:13:57,862 --> 01:13:58,713
Look, you know.

844
01:14:00,177 --> 01:14:01,241
I'm still here.

845
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:04,075
She's still out there.

846
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:07,853
But we need your help, Charles.

847
01:14:09,097 --> 01:14:10,900
Not like this,
I need you.

848
01:14:11,225 --> 01:14:12,507
We can't  find Raven..

849
01:14:12,772 --> 01:14:13,772
..not without your powers.

850
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:20,642
I added a little extra
cause you missed a dose.

851
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:27,036
Charles.

852
01:14:58,517 --> 01:15:00,068
Hank, do me a favour.

853
01:15:01,488 --> 01:15:03,203
Would you help me to my study please.

854
01:15:08,548 --> 01:15:10,056
Gonna get you.

855
01:15:20,818 --> 01:15:22,302
Are you sure about this?

856
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:25,598
Absolutely not.

857
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:34,942
This creature is extraordinary.

858
01:15:36,424 --> 01:15:39,175
Her genes could hold the
key to mutation itself.

859
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:41,209
I need more.

860
01:15:41,427 --> 01:15:44,397
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

861
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:45,559
More than blood.

862
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:47,439
I need brain tissue.

863
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:49,252
Spinal fluid.

864
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,236
Bone marrow.

865
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:56,136
Imagine sentinels that could
transform, adapt to any target.

866
01:15:56,828 --> 01:15:58,316
If I just get my hands on her.

867
01:15:58,614 --> 01:16:04,347
This girl could lead the program forward
years, decades into the future.

868
01:16:06,058 --> 01:16:07,218
How old is your son now, Major?

869
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:09,263
Jason?

870
01:16:09,953 --> 01:16:11,852
He's coming up on 10 now
if you can believe it.

871
01:16:11,988 --> 01:16:13,422
Eight years from fighting age.

872
01:16:13,821 --> 01:16:17,192
And how many of our sons and brothers did
we just ship home in body bags?

873
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:19,429
Maybe 50? 55000?

874
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:21,319
How many more in the other side?

875
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:23,619
Never before,

876
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:26,659
in all of human history,

877
01:16:27,885 --> 01:16:31,879
Has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species?

878
01:16:33,384 --> 01:16:34,821
Until now.

879
01:16:37,169 --> 01:16:39,228
You really hate mutants doctor, don't you?

880
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:44,287
On the contrary, I rather admire
them the things they can do.

881
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:48,222
I assume mutants as our salvation.

882
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:49,849
And common enemy.

883
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:53,708
Common struggle against the ultimate enemy.

884
01:16:54,566 --> 01:16:55,967
Extinction.

885
01:16:56,890 --> 01:17:00,299
I believe our new friends are going
to help us usher in a new era, Bill.

886
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:05,413
A new era of genuine and
long lasting peace.

887
01:17:19,564 --> 01:17:21,309
<i> Attention! Attention! </i>

888
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:23,534
<i> Transport departure
in two hours. </i>

889
01:17:23,535 --> 01:17:24,051
<i> Repeat. </I>

890
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:27,161
<i> Transport departure
begins in two hours. </i>

891
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:35,762
When was the last time you down here?

892
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:39,312
-Last time we went looking for students.
- A life time ago.

893
01:17:46,326 --> 01:17:47,451
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

894
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:14,080
Raven is wounded, she won't be moving fast.

895
01:18:22,548 --> 01:18:24,778
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

896
01:18:45,369 --> 01:18:46,306
Gosh!

897
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:54,802
<i>-No!
-Who are you?</i>

898
01:19:11,923 --> 01:19:12,720
Charles!

899
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,351
Charles, It's alright.

900
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:27,928
I'll go check the generator.

901
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:37,838
It's not the machinery, Is it?

902
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:41,221
-I can't do this, my mind...
-Yes you can.

903
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,243
-It won't take it.
-It's just a little rusty.

904
01:19:43,434 --> 01:19:45,474
You do not understand, It’s
not a question of being rusty.

905
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,471
I can flip the switches,
I can turn the knobs.

906
01:19:47,613 --> 01:19:50,009
But my power comes from
here, comes from ..

907
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,831
And it's broken.

908
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,681
I feel like one of my students.

909
01:19:56,734 --> 01:19:57,723
Helpless.

910
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,486
It was a mistake coming down here.
It was a mistake freeing, Eric.

911
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,679
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

912
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,305
I'm Sorry, Logan,
they sent back the wrong man.

913
01:20:08,006 --> 01:20:09,031
You're right.

914
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:11,999
I’m.

915
01:20:13,423 --> 01:20:14,895
Actually it was supposed to be you.

916
01:20:16,048 --> 01:20:18,418
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

917
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,088
And ahh don't know how long we've got here.

918
01:20:23,923 --> 01:20:26,238
But I do know that a long time actually,

919
01:20:26,983 --> 01:20:28,941
A long time from now.

920
01:20:29,962 --> 01:20:32,498
I was your lost helpless student.

921
01:20:33,488 --> 01:20:35,827
and you unlocked my mind.

922
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:40,140
You showed me what I was,
you showed me what I could be.

923
01:20:40,942 --> 01:20:42,748
I don't know how to do that for you,

924
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:44,260
You're right, I don't.

925
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,212
But I know someone who might.

926
01:20:51,051 --> 01:20:53,275
Look into my mind.

927
01:20:54,088 --> 01:20:55,699
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

928
01:20:56,499 --> 01:20:57,844
You don't want me inside your head.

929
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,513
There's no damage you can do.
That has already been done, trust me.

930
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:13,606
Hey.

931
01:21:16,349 --> 01:21:17,925
-Hey, Logan.
-Hey, Jean.

932
01:21:18,802 --> 01:21:20,359
-Kill me.
-I love you.

933
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:25,280
You're a..

934
01:21:27,214 --> 01:21:28,631
..poor man.

935
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:29,249
Look past me.

936
01:21:29,315 --> 01:21:34,182
I don't want suffering!
I don't want your future!

937
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:35,803
Pass my future.

938
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:37,838
Look for your future.

939
01:21:42,037 --> 01:21:42,912
That's it.

940
01:21:43,972 --> 01:21:44,878
That's it.

941
01:21:46,487 --> 01:21:47,191
That's it.

942
01:22:36,142 --> 01:22:37,608
Charles.

943
01:22:40,109 --> 01:22:41,304
Charles.

944
01:22:45,636 --> 01:22:47,369
So this is what become of us?

945
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,416
Erik was right.

946
01:22:51,796 --> 01:22:53,718
Humanity does this to us.

947
01:22:53,919 --> 01:22:56,319
Not if we show them a better path.

948
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,220
You still believe?

949
01:22:59,303 --> 01:23:01,979
just because someone
stumbles, loses their way,

950
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:04,545
It doesn't mean they're lost forever.

951
01:23:05,624 --> 01:23:09,117
Sometimes we all need a little help.

952
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:12,111
I'm not the man I was.

953
01:23:14,499 --> 01:23:15,640
I opened my mind,

954
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:19,391
It almost overwhelms me.

955
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:20,569
You're afraid.

956
01:23:21,366 --> 01:23:23,572
and Cerebro knows it.

957
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:25,880
All those voices..

958
01:23:28,581 --> 01:23:33,075
So..... much...... pain.

959
01:23:33,553 --> 01:23:35,613
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

960
01:23:37,032 --> 01:23:39,057
It's yours Charles.

961
01:23:40,269 --> 01:23:42,428
And as frightening as it may be,

962
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:45,016
That pain will make you stronger.

963
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:48,537
If you allow yourself to feel it,

964
01:23:49,368 --> 01:23:51,017
embrace it.

965
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:55,824
It will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

966
01:23:56,543 --> 01:23:59,832
It's the greatest gift we have,

967
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,340
to bear their pain without breaking.

968
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,776
And it's born from the most human power

969
01:24:09,456 --> 01:24:10,255
Hope.

970
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:21,354
Please,

971
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:22,715
Charles,

972
01:24:22,802 --> 01:24:25,855
we need to hope again.

973
01:24:34,888 --> 01:24:36,832
Find what you were looking for?

974
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,146
Power is back on.

975
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:45,190
Yes.

976
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,995
Yes it is.

977
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:30,502
She's lost too much blood.

978
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:33,944
-She can't keep going like this
-We have no choice, Bobby.

979
01:26:34,793 --> 01:26:35,722
We can wake him up.

980
01:26:35,787 --> 01:26:36,477
No.

981
01:26:37,756 --> 01:26:38,944
They need more time.

982
01:26:39,618 --> 01:26:44,280
I had a glimpse into the past,

983
01:26:44,395 --> 01:26:49,231
If we wake logan now we may set off an
even darker course.

984
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:50,865
They need more time.

985
01:27:10,571 --> 01:27:12,481
Raven, stop.

986
01:27:13,302 --> 01:27:14,199
Stop running.

987
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:15,945
Charles.

988
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:19,310
Where are you?

989
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:20,620
Back at the house.

990
01:27:20,809 --> 01:27:22,356
..where you should be.

991
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:24,830
I need you to come home.

992
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,179
I know what I need to do.

993
01:27:31,406 --> 01:27:32,247
If you kill Trask,

994
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:34,460
You will be creating
countless more just like him.

995
01:27:34,968 --> 01:27:36,172
Then I'll kill them too.

996
01:27:36,357 --> 01:27:38,541
Those are Erick's works not yours.

997
01:27:42,478 --> 01:27:44,960
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing,

998
01:27:45,154 --> 01:27:48,575
She was good, fair, full of compassion.

999
01:27:49,909 --> 01:27:52,816
I have compassion,
just not for Trask.

1000
01:27:53,016 --> 01:27:54,813
<i>He's murdered too many of us. </i>

1001
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,719
Shut her down Charles, get in her head.

1002
01:28:01,184 --> 01:28:05,352
She's not letting me in I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

1003
01:28:13,867 --> 01:28:15,510
I know what Trask has done.

1004
01:28:16,452 --> 01:28:18,476
But, killing him will not bring them back.

1005
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,280
it will set you on a path from which
there is no return

1006
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:24,881
An endless cycle of killing

1007
01:28:25,068 --> 01:28:26,867
us and them,

1008
01:28:27,038 --> 01:28:28,576
till there is nothing left.

1009
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:32,040
But we can stop it  right now.

1010
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,240
You and I.

1011
01:28:34,723 --> 01:28:37,000
<i> You just have to come home. </i>

1012
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:39,894
I have to .

1013
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:42,921
You haven't changed at all, Charles.

1014
01:28:43,798 --> 01:28:45,015
<i> Like I said. </i>

1015
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:47,224
I know exactly what I have to do.

1016
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:03,588
Where is he?

1017
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,462
At an airport boarding a plane.

1018
01:29:06,701 --> 01:29:08,369
Plane to where?

1019
01:29:10,927 --> 01:29:12,597
Washington DC.

1020
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,610
Hey guys,

1021
01:29:16,379 --> 01:29:18,629
There is something I need to show to you.

1022
01:29:20,357 --> 01:29:22,166
<i>We're going backwards in time.</i>

1023
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:25,603
This the system I designed to
record any news about Paris,

1024
01:29:25,906 --> 01:29:28,168
over all 3 networks and PBS.

1025
01:29:28,681 --> 01:29:30,390
All three? wow

1026
01:29:30,711 --> 01:29:32,345
Yeah and PBS.

1027
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:34,582
Look what I found.

1028
01:29:34,919 --> 01:29:38,147
Tomorrow in front of the white house the
president will make his announcement .

1029
01:29:38,384 --> 01:29:40,745
He'll be joined by secretary
of defense Blair.

1030
01:29:40,828 --> 01:29:44,269
And has even sought the help of
renowned scientist Bolivar Trask.

1031
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,103
<i>His special adviser to combat
this mutant issue. </I>

1032
01:29:47,489 --> 01:29:48,811
<i> White House is.... </i>

1033
01:29:49,174 --> 01:29:53,760
Raven doesn't realize but if she kills trask at
an event like that with the whole world watching

1034
01:29:55,806 --> 01:29:57,688
Then I came a long way for nothing.

1035
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,975
And there's more bad
news, I saw in a report.

1036
01:30:01,243 --> 01:30:03,197
They found traces of her blood in paris.

1037
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:05,909
<i>for all we know they
already have her DNA </i>.

1038
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:07,289
<i> That's all they need, </i>

1039
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:09,316
to create the
sentinels in the future.

1040
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:16,308
Now there's a theory in time
physics that time is immutable.

1041
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,732
It's like a river, you can throw a pebble and it will
create a ripple but the current always corrects itself.

1042
01:30:22,936 --> 01:30:26,657
No matter what you do the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

1043
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:28,488
What are you trying to say?

1044
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:29,969
I was saying is..

1045
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:32,177
what if the war is inevitable.

1046
01:30:32,603 --> 01:30:34,403
What if she's meant to kill Trask.

1047
01:30:35,949 --> 01:30:38,396
What if this is just simply who she is.

1048
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:44,120
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way.

1049
01:30:44,925 --> 01:30:46,707
Doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1050
01:30:51,866 --> 01:30:53,834
I don't believe that  theory, Hank.

1051
01:30:55,769 --> 01:30:57,896
And I can not believe that who she is.

1052
01:31:00,308 --> 01:31:02,808
Ready the plane
we're going to washington.

1053
01:31:05,061 --> 01:31:07,124
Washington. D.C.

1054
01:32:21,691 --> 01:32:22,621
You alright ?

1055
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,918
Getting there.

1056
01:32:29,225 --> 01:32:31,733
Whatever happens today, I need
you to promise me something.

1057
01:32:32,736 --> 01:32:35,762
You looked into my mind and you've seen
a lot of bad but,

1058
01:32:36,674 --> 01:32:38,019
You've seen the good too.

1059
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:40,197
The X-Men.

1060
01:32:42,274 --> 01:32:43,635
Promise me you'll find us.

1061
01:32:45,784 --> 01:32:47,762
Use your power, bring us together.

1062
01:32:48,393 --> 01:32:50,060
Guide us. Lead us.

1063
01:32:52,154 --> 01:32:52,834
Storm,

1064
01:32:53,623 --> 01:32:54,467
Scott,

1065
01:32:56,795 --> 01:32:57,945
Jean.

1066
01:32:59,765 --> 01:33:01,102
Remember those names.

1067
01:33:02,768 --> 01:33:04,036
There's so many of us.

1068
01:33:05,737 --> 01:33:07,898
We will need you, Professor.

1069
01:33:10,843 --> 01:33:13,248
I will do my best.

1070
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:14,771
Your best is enough.

1071
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,137
Trust me.

1072
01:33:43,131 --> 01:33:45,395
12 carriers inbound, 10 miles.

1073
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,267
They found us.

1074
01:34:04,711 --> 01:34:09,515
<i> Thousands of people will be gathered here, they
come from all over the world witness history </i>

1075
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:13,113
Along with news crews from
at least 50 different countries.

1076
01:34:14,688 --> 01:34:15,398
Thank you.

1077
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,029
Can I see your invitations please?

1078
01:34:20,727 --> 01:34:21,938
Yes you may..

1079
01:34:22,047 --> 01:34:23,259
these two are with me.

1080
01:34:23,485 --> 01:34:24,474
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1081
01:34:32,177 --> 01:34:32,900
<i> Logan. </i>

1082
01:34:33,556 --> 01:34:34,905
Please, this way, sir.

1083
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:00,718
It's fine...

1084
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,916
I haven't found her yet
but she has to be here.

1085
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,913
<i> President of the United States. </i>

1086
01:35:28,454 --> 01:35:29,830
My fellow Americans,

1087
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:34,982
<i> Today we face the greatest
threat in our history. </i>

1088
01:35:35,318 --> 01:35:36,070
Mutants.

1089
01:35:36,655 --> 01:35:37,654
<i>I'm pregnant..</i>

1090
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,608
We have prepared for this threat.

1091
01:35:44,929 --> 01:35:47,804
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer.

1092
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:49,772
Behold..

1093
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,350
The world will never be the same again.

1094
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:24,802
Can I help you?

1095
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:29,019
No, you can't.

1096
01:37:06,915 --> 01:37:07,886
Here they come.

1097
01:37:15,105 --> 01:37:16,752
<i>This for you brothers and sisters. </i>

1098
01:37:19,785 --> 01:37:20,324
Raven.

1099
01:37:23,353 --> 01:37:24,479
I have her.

1100
01:37:24,967 --> 01:37:26,465
Let me go, Charles.

1101
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,740
There.
You see?

1102
01:37:30,167 --> 01:37:32,191
Secret service man
left to the stage.

1103
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:33,224
-Got it.
-Go.

1104
01:37:54,097 --> 01:37:55,746
What the hell are you doing?

1105
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,390
I didn't tell you to activate it.

1106
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:58,294
I didn't.

1107
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,784
Raven, please listen to me.

1108
01:38:19,614 --> 01:38:22,823
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1109
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,065
Don't do this.

1110
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,601
Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point.

1111
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:42,102
We can't stop that many.

1112
01:38:42,657 --> 01:38:43,135
No.

1113
01:38:43,545 --> 01:38:45,245
But, we can slow them down.

1114
01:39:23,386 --> 01:39:25,159
Erik!

1115
01:40:00,697 --> 01:40:02,059
Move it ! Comon let's go!!

1116
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:11,233
Storm!

1117
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:51,726
<i> Take us to Def-con 3.
Mr. President we are code red. </i>

1118
01:40:51,797 --> 01:40:52,947
<i> Air defense ready now. </i>

1119
01:40:54,503 --> 01:40:55,905
<i> What the hell happened out there? </i>

1120
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:56,817
I'll fix it.

1121
01:40:57,237 --> 01:40:58,204
You said that before,

1122
01:40:58,237 --> 01:40:59,425
I wanted to make a statement.

1123
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:02,069
<i> Now the whole goddamn world knows
we can't protect them.</i>

1124
01:41:02,574 --> 01:41:03,767
<i>I will fix it. </i>

1125
01:41:03,786 --> 01:41:04,785
<i>You damn well better.</i>

1126
01:42:16,726 --> 01:42:17,692
Charles!

1127
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,886
Is everybody okay?

1128
01:43:42,047 --> 01:43:43,065
Storm!

1129
01:43:46,943 --> 01:43:47,999
Behind you.

1130
01:44:32,413 --> 01:44:33,195
Now.

1131
01:44:56,937 --> 01:44:59,075
I'm probably not supposed to
ask this kind of a thing.

1132
01:44:59,309 --> 01:45:02,638
But in the future,
do I make it?

1133
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:03,991
No.

1134
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:08,163
But we can change that, right?

1135
01:45:20,024 --> 01:45:21,798
Do what you were made for.

1136
01:45:22,839 --> 01:45:24,075
Mutants.

1137
01:45:31,253 --> 01:45:32,193
Where are you?

1138
01:45:49,436 --> 01:45:51,868
I got this. Go.

1139
01:46:33,853 --> 01:46:35,064
Oh dear god, no.

1140
01:46:50,856 --> 01:46:52,993
So much for being a survivor.

1141
01:47:36,023 --> 01:47:37,275
One of them is in here.

1142
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:40,787
<i>No! No! No! </i>

1143
01:47:40,877 --> 01:47:41,649
<i> Don't kill it. </i>

1144
01:47:41,928 --> 01:47:42,985
I need it alive.

1145
01:47:56,572 --> 01:47:58,044
What the hell has happened?

1146
01:49:06,329 --> 01:49:08,534
You built  these weapons to destroy us.

1147
01:49:09,469 --> 01:49:10,403
Why?

1148
01:49:14,954 --> 01:49:17,642
Because you're afraid of our gifts.

1149
01:49:18,425 --> 01:49:20,210
Because we are different.

1150
01:49:22,115 --> 01:49:26,065
Humanity has always feared that
which is different.

1151
01:49:26,051 --> 01:49:28,518
But I'm here to tell you, tell the world.

1152
01:49:29,927 --> 01:49:31,786
You're right to fear us.

1153
01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:33,666
<i>We are the future.</i>

1154
01:49:34,772 --> 01:49:37,319
We are the ones who will
inherit this earth.

1155
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,061
And anyone who stands in our way,

1156
01:49:40,106 --> 01:49:44,111
Will suffer the same fate as
these men you see before you.

1157
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:54,490
Today was meant to be a
display of your power.

1158
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:00,390
Instead I give you a glimpse of the
devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1159
01:50:09,464 --> 01:50:12,357
<i>Let this be a warning to the world. </i>

1160
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:15,710
<i> And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there, </i>

1161
01:50:16,207 --> 01:50:17,803
<i> I say this: </i>

1162
01:50:18,047 --> 01:50:19,572
<i> No more hiding. </i>

1163
01:50:20,032 --> 01:50:21,756
<i> No more suffering. </i>

1164
01:50:22,942 --> 01:50:28,402
You've lived in a shadows in shame
and fear too long. Come out.

1165
01:50:29,323 --> 01:50:34,317
<i> Join me, fight together in the
brotherhood of our kind. </i>

1166
01:50:34,808 --> 01:50:36,567
New tomorrow.

1167
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,016
..that starts today.

1168
01:50:46,982 --> 01:50:50,720
All those years wasted fighting
each other, Charles

1169
01:50:54,359 --> 01:50:57,921
To have a precious few of them back.

1170
01:51:36,897 --> 01:51:37,460
Mr. President.

1171
01:51:37,508 --> 01:51:39,249
Stand down ! I said stand down!

1172
01:51:41,892 --> 01:51:43,510
You want to make a statement?

1173
01:51:43,995 --> 01:51:45,764
<i>  Kill me...finally </i>

1174
01:51:46,188 --> 01:51:48,000
<i> But spare everyone else! </i>

1175
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,429
Very heroic, Mr. President.

1176
01:52:03,422 --> 01:52:06,090
But you had no intention
of sparing any of us.

1177
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:10,778
The future of our
species begins now.

1178
01:52:15,155 --> 01:52:15,701
<i>Mutant</i>

1179
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:20,987
<i>Mutants</i>

1180
01:52:46,121 --> 01:52:47,355
You used to be a better shot.

1181
01:52:47,413 --> 01:52:48,755
Trust me, I still I'm.

1182
01:53:02,255 --> 01:53:03,867
Get out of my head, Charles!

1183
01:53:04,122 --> 01:53:04,810
Raven,

1184
01:53:05,739 --> 01:53:07,724
Please do not make us the enemy
today.

1185
01:53:08,038 --> 01:53:09,708
Look around you, we already are.

1186
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:11,851
They not all of us.

1187
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:13,994
All you've done so far

1188
01:53:14,133 --> 01:53:16,646
Is save the lives
of these men.

1189
01:53:17,626 --> 01:53:19,935
You can show them a better path.

1190
01:53:23,978 --> 01:53:25,719
Shut her down, Charles

1191
01:53:27,743 --> 01:53:30,945
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met.

1192
01:53:31,675 --> 01:53:33,402
And look what that's got us

1193
01:53:35,544 --> 01:53:38,375
Everything that happens now,

1194
01:53:39,195 --> 01:53:40,523
is in your hand.

1195
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:48,326
I have a faith in you, Raven.

1196
01:55:27,356 --> 01:55:28,921
He's all yours, Charles.

1197
01:55:57,227 --> 01:55:59,419
If you let them have me
I'm as good as dead.

1198
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:00,861
You know that.

1199
01:56:01,928 --> 01:56:02,657
I know.

1200
01:56:05,607 --> 01:56:06,639
Good-bye, old friend.

1201
01:56:09,653 --> 01:56:10,786
Good-bye, Erik.

1202
01:56:44,604 --> 01:56:46,654
You sure you should let them go?

1203
01:56:48,094 --> 01:56:48,695
<i> Yes. </I>

1204
01:56:49,495 --> 01:56:51,333
<i> I have hope for them. </I>

1205
01:56:52,451 --> 01:56:54,545
<i> It's going to be a time, Hank. </I>

1206
01:56:54,546 --> 01:56:56,375
When we're all together.

1207
01:57:00,477 --> 01:57:02,097
<i> What about Logan? </I>

1208
01:58:32,366 --> 01:58:34,691
Good morning, Logan.
Late start. Hah hah ha.

1209
01:58:45,076 --> 01:58:47,243
<i> Have a good lunch time.
Good job. </i>

1210
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:49,268
-Thank you.
-Very good job.

1211
01:58:50,717 --> 01:58:51,642
<i> Storm. </I>

1212
01:59:23,056 --> 01:59:23,723
Jean.

1213
01:59:25,693 --> 01:59:26,542
Hi, Logan.

1214
01:59:29,365 --> 01:59:30,421
Are you okay?

1215
01:59:32,682 --> 01:59:33,554
You're here.

1216
01:59:34,698 --> 01:59:35,801
Where else would I be?

1217
01:59:39,147 --> 01:59:39,937
Woh.

1218
01:59:40,932 --> 01:59:41,931
Easy, pal.

1219
01:59:44,648 --> 01:59:45,883
Some things never change.

1220
01:59:48,437 --> 01:59:49,464
Good to see you, Scott.

1221
01:59:51,831 --> 01:59:52,550
Ah ha.

1222
01:59:52,867 --> 01:59:53,938
See you later, Jean.

1223
01:59:58,242 --> 01:59:59,207
Professor.

1224
02:00:00,278 --> 02:00:00,917
Logan.

1225
02:00:01,826 --> 02:00:02,907
Is everything alright?

1226
02:00:06,645 --> 02:00:07,069
Yeah.

1227
02:00:09,138 --> 02:00:10,550
Yeah, I think it is.

1228
02:00:27,565 --> 02:00:28,394
You did it.

1229
02:00:29,102 --> 02:00:29,734
Did what?

1230
02:00:30,148 --> 02:00:31,816
Logan, don't you have a class to teach?

1231
02:00:32,957 --> 02:00:33,664
A class?

1232
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:35,154
To teach. What?

1233
02:00:35,537 --> 02:00:36,342
History.

1234
02:00:37,177 --> 02:00:37,851
History?

1235
02:00:39,581 --> 02:00:41,088
History, I could use some help with that.

1236
02:00:41,691 --> 02:00:42,699
Help with what?

1237
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:46,565
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1238
02:00:51,759 --> 02:00:54,319
I think history I know
is little different.

1239
02:00:56,176 --> 02:00:57,470
Welcome back.

1240
02:01:00,717 --> 02:01:02,045
It's good to see you, Charles.

1241
02:01:03,936 --> 02:01:04,981
It's good to see everyone.

1242
02:01:05,588 --> 02:01:06,494
Well,

1243
02:01:07,794 --> 02:01:09,223
I had a promise to keep.

1244
02:01:11,082 --> 02:01:14,244
You and I have lot of catching up to do.

1245
02:01:15,259 --> 02:01:15,820
Yes.

1246
02:01:20,443 --> 02:01:22,193
What is the last thing you remember?

1247
02:01:27,608 --> 02:01:28,542
Drowning.

1248
02:01:37,739 --> 02:01:38,942
<i> The past, </i>

1249
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,135
<i> a new and uncertain world. </i>

1250
02:01:54,927 --> 02:01:57,559
<i> A world  of endless possibilities. </i>

1251
02:01:59,826 --> 02:02:02,002
<i>  and infinite outcomes. </i>

1252
02:02:03,795 --> 02:02:04,717
<i>Can we?</i>

1253
02:02:04,929 --> 02:02:06,103
<i>Oh he is alive!</i>

1254
02:02:06,458 --> 02:02:07,562
<i>He is breathing</i>

1255
02:02:10,713 --> 02:02:13,676
<i> Countless choices define our fate. </i>

1256
02:02:14,569 --> 02:02:19,319
<i> Each choice, each moment a
ripple in the river of time.</i>

1257
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:21,610
What do you want us to do with him,
Major Striker?

1258
02:02:22,519 --> 02:02:25,602
<i> Enough ripples and you
change the tide.</i>

1259
02:02:26,978 --> 02:02:28,086
I'll take him from here.

1260
02:02:28,376 --> 02:02:32,156
<i>For the future is never truly set.</i>
