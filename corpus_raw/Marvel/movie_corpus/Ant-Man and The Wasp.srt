2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,802
<i>I still think
about the night</i>

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,540
<i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i>

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,687
Hopefully,
it's not for long,

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,757
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,426
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

7
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:18,430
Mommy?

8
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:23,105
Jellybean.

9
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:27,882
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

10
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,487
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,824
No. I don't want you to go.

12
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,830
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

13
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,301
I won't be able to keep my...

14
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:38,704
eyes...

15
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:45,149
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,521
Okay.

17
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:49,156
Janet, we gotta go.

18
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:54,199
<i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i>

19
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,738
<i>tucked you back
into your bed...</i>

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,545
<i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i>

21
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:04,888
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,692
They've already launched.

23
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:07,961
We have to stop it.

24
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:08,765
Come on.

25
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:21,321
<i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i>

26
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:24,294
<i>but the plating was too thick.</i>

27
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

28
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:31,943
I can't get through.

29
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:35,014
Hank.

30
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:38,621
<i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i>

31
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:39,690
<i>there is no coming back.</i>

32
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:44,802
<i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i>

33
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,942
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

34
00:01:49,313 --> 00:01:51,514
Tell Hope I love her.

35
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:52,518
<i>She turned it off.</i>

36
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,820
Janet. No!

37
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:56,626
<i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i>

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,876
<i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i>

39
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:08,949
<i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i>

40
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:11,390
<i>Alone.</i>

41
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,790
<i>Afraid.</i>

42
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,530
<i>Gone forever.</i>

43
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,998
<i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i>

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,705
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

45
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,017
But then Scott showed up.

46
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,992
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

47
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,030
<i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i>

48
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,707
<i>and came back.</i>

49
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,911
<i>Everything changed.</i>

50
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,751
I started to wonder...

51
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,757
could your mother
still be alive?

52
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,401
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

53
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,890
Dad, what are you saying?

54
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:23,766
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

55
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,782
Okay. We're in.

56
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,257
Oh, this place is a maze.

57
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,129
Where's that map?

58
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,870
We're definitely close.

59
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,041
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

60
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,844
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

61
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,014
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

62
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:25,154
I eat fear for breakfast.

63
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,759
Wow. That is super cool.

64
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,862
Come on.

65
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,642
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

66
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,113
Anton, which way do we go?

67
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:42,990
Anton, which way do we go?

68
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,941
Thanks, Anton!

69
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,916
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

70
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:58,622
Oh no, lasers!

71
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:02,798
Oh! I think I got lased!

72
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:07,072
The secret vault.

73
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,409
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

74
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,081
Yup.

75
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,091
Perfect! Right there.

76
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:22,435
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

77
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,805
My trophy?

78
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,108
It looks like treasure.

79
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,777
Oh, it is to me.

80
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,115
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

81
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,250
Oh, no,
you can't do that.

82
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:33,824
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

83
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,827
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

84
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,130
I'm so touched you think

85
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:39,134
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

86
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,435
It was the only one
they had.

87
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,240
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

88
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,813
Oh, no, the fuzz!

89
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:46,983
Hey, Scotty...

90
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,120
I was looking
at the schematics

91
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,488
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

92
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,858
and I think we have

93
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,127
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

94
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,462
No, no, not at all.

95
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:54,897
I mean, 'cause it's a lot
of security cameras.

96
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,269
I know what he needs.

97
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,038
Who's the security expert
in our business?

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,940
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

99
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,009
And if we overquote him...

100
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:01,110
he's gonna go somewhere else.

101
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,214
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

102
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,483
He ain't goin' anywhere.

103
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,019
And the expression is
"land this fish."

104
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,421
No, it's "land the bird."

105
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:07,791
Just like you land the plane.

106
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,026
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

107
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,230
I know it's silly
to get hung up

108
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,865
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

109
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,235
How am I gonna land a fish?

110
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,238
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

111
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,877
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

112
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,315
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

113
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,286
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

114
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:23,589
Now, if you just excuse me...

115
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,858
I'm in the middle of trying to

116
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,993
steal something
with my daughter.

117
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,130
I'm gonna go recheck it.

118
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,336
To the escape ant!

119
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,843
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

120
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,882
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

121
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:38,485
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

122
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,310
Crash landing!

123
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,447
Whoo!

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,521
I wish we could shrink
for real.

125
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:58,659
Oh. That is pretty cool.

126
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,462
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

127
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,899
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

128
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,233
But I feel
like I'm way better.

129
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:05,337
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

130
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,474
And my hands are shaking.

131
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,077
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

132
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,281
It's gonna be great, Luis!

133
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,382
You got nothing
to worry about!

134
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:13,255
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

135
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,356
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:15,627
Daddy!

137
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,043
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

138
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,411
Why would I try to escape?

139
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,483
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

140
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,954
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

141
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,058
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

142
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,558
Thank you.

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,031
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

144
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,170
Our flying ant crashed.

145
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,570
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

146
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,974
when you can't leave
the house.

147
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,045
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

148
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,685
Close-up magic.

149
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,627
I learned that.

150
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,333
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

151
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,072
Oh, Cassie.

152
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,142
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

153
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,012
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

154
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,615
Well, think of it this way.

155
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:02,420
Your school has rules, right?

156
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,522
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

157
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,526
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

158
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,630
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

159
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:11,271
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

160
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,341
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

161
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,478
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,716
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

163
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,586
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

164
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:22,224
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

165
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,128
followed by three years
of probation.

166
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,101
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

167
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,373
or contact with any
former associates who were...

168
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,579
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

169
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,148
Or any related statutes.

170
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,386
Okay, sweetie?

171
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,258
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,531
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

173
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,834
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

174
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:45,406
but you haven't had
any contact

175
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,840
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

176
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,679
- No.
- You sure?

177
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,748
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

178
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,387
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

179
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:56,392
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

180
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,699
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

181
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,502
that any violation
of your agreement

182
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,539
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

183
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,843
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

184
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,813
They hate his guts.

185
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:06,817
Thanks, peanut.

186
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,156
How'd you do it, Scott?

187
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:11,691
Do what?

188
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:14,832
The card trick.

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,469
Seriously?

190
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,204
Oh, my God!

191
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,576
You people
can't just show up here

192
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,847
whenever you want
and search the place.

193
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:23,949
Actually, they can.

194
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,217
You need a warrant.

195
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,419
Actually, they don't.

196
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,557
Really? Wow.

197
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,361
Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

198
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:33,233
- Yeah.
- All right.

199
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:35,537
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

200
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,575
All right.

201
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,277
Oh, get on
the inside of this.

202
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:42,384
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

203
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,653
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

204
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:44,989
You know what?
Give me another one.

205
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,427
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

206
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:50,001
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

207
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,737
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

208
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,840
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

209
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,479
Once I'm outta here, you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

210
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,618
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

211
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,570
You're gettin'
good at that.

212
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,640
How'd you do that?

213
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,443
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

214
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,216
- Bye.
- Bye.

215
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,326
Three days.

216
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,329
Easy-peasy.

217
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,518
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

218
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,357
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

219
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,532
<i>♪ We had a dream</i>

220
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,536
<i>♪ We'd go travelin' together</i>

221
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:44,378
<i>♪ We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on ♪</i>

222
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,507
Easy-peasy.

223
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,857
<i>Where are you?</i>

224
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,513
<i>Everything
that you know...</i>

225
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,887
<i>Lost...</i>

226
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,093
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

227
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,511
<i>What?</i>

228
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,581
I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

229
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,728
I found you!

230
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,701
You always find me, Mommy.

231
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,606
<i>What the hell?</i>

232
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,775
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

233
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,648
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

234
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,884
And I'm probably
the last person

235
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,255
you wanna hear from.

236
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,929
But I just had
a really weird dream.

237
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,131
And I know that doesn't

238
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,267
sound like an emergency
or anything...

239
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,243
but it just felt very real.

240
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,249
I was back
in the quantum realm...

241
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:48,623
and I think I saw your wife.

242
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,758
And then I was your wife.

243
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,600
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

244
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,141
You know,
hearing this out loud,

245
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

246
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,686
I'm sorry to bother you.

247
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:06,125
I'm sorry
for a lot of things.

248
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,681
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

249
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:23,826
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

250
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:58,763
Hope?

251
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,738
Is this another dream?

252
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,940
Do you think it was a dream...

253
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,346
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

254
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,716
I'm not sure.

255
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,791
I can't be here!

256
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,496
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

257
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,134
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

258
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,079
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

259
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,281
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

260
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,218
you're still at home.

261
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,368
Whoa!

262
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:58,449
Scotty?

263
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,352
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

264
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:02,088
Nine hours in bed.

265
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,390
Five hours
in front of the TV.

266
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:05,494
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

267
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,265
That's totally inaccurate.

268
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,969
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

269
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:09,969
Are you spying on me?

270
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:12,007
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

271
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,879
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,924
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

273
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,460
They said it was
a matter of national security.

274
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,097
That Cap needed help, so...

275
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,133
Cap?

276
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:28,373
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

277
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,444
It's what we call him.

278
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,180
If you're a friend.

279
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,283
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

280
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:35,153
He's nice. Whatever.

281
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,624
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

282
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:38,928
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

283
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:42,100
How's Hank?

284
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:44,037
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

285
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,440
How do you think he is?

286
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,445
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

287
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,047
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

288
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,651
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

289
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,255
because we need
what's in your head.

290
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:34,070
Is this where
you're living?

291
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:37,612
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

292
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,214
We're fine.

293
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,266
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

294
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,269
Save it!

295
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,813
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

296
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,452
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

297
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:50,859
we were building this.

298
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:53,798
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

299
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,434
To my mom.

300
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:57,536
We think she might still
be down there.

301
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,439
We just don't know where.

302
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,342
What?

303
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,514
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

304
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,617
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

305
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:05,753
You built all this
and you don't even know

306
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:07,323
if she's alive?

307
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,393
It's called a hypothesis.

308
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:12,298
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

309
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,571
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

310
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,275
But for a split second,

311
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:18,814
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

312
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,084
And?

313
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:24,224
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

314
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:26,427
We think
when you were down there,

315
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,963
you may have entangled
with her.

316
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,969
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

317
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,539
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

318
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,843
We think she might have put

319
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,011
some kind of a message
in your head.

320
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,982
Hopefully, a location.

321
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:38,786
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

322
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,657
Your mom put a message
in my head?

323
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,426
Come on. That's insane.

324
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:43,662
No, Scott.

325
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,067
Insane is going to Germany

326
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,604
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

327
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,679
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

328
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,851
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

329
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,021
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

330
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,893
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

331
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,765
That was my life's work!

332
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,000
What was I supposed to do?

333
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:05,907
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

334
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,075
I'm sorry, Hank!

335
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,711
I'm sorry I took the suit.

336
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,084
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

337
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:12,886
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

338
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,391
I wish that I did.

339
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:15,293
I just had a dream about her

340
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,864
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

341
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:20,973
What?

342
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,747
I had a dream.

343
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,552
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

344
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,421
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

345
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:31,824
Doesn't mean anything.

346
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:33,763
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

347
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,030
No.

348
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,501
Where was she hiding?

349
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:38,036
- What?
- The little girl.

350
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:39,875
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

351
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,516
No, it was
in a tall dresser.

352
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,816
You mean a wardrobe.

353
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,119
Is that what that's called?

354
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,590
What color was it?

355
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:49,029
Red.

356
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:52,900
Were there horses on it?

357
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:54,571
Oh, boy.

358
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,611
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

359
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,582
It doesn't sound like

360
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:02,421
you really got the gist
of the game.

361
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,626
She's alive.

362
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,032
I knew it.

363
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,104
I knew it!

364
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,209
We need to get that part.

365
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,578
Okay.

366
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,251
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

367
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:20,654
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

368
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,026
Does Burch have it?

369
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,527
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

370
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,466
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

371
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,705
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

372
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,275
from overloading again.

373
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,815
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

374
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,037
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

375
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:46,673
but if I'm not at home
when they come

376
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:47,875
to take off
my ankle monitor...

377
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,312
then I'm going away forever.

378
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,651
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

379
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:53,654
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

380
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:55,792
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

381
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:57,662
You owe us.

382
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:59,667
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

383
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,804
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

384
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:12,259
Let's go.

385
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:31,796
- We good?
- Yeah.

386
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,166
I'll be right back.

387
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,152
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

388
00:21:57,016 --> 00:22:00,386
Ah. Susan! Welcome to <i>Oui!</i>

389
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:02,190
Sonny!

390
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:04,394
<i>Oui</i> is French
for "yes."

391
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:06,734
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

392
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:09,107
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

393
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:12,142
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

394
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,713
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

395
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:18,355
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

396
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:19,726
Have a seat.

397
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:20,460
No, I'm good. Thank you.

398
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:22,331
Who is this guy?

399
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,971
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

400
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:27,910
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

401
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,482
Could I just have one...

402
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,754
No.

403
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:36,861
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

404
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:38,194
And I say "special"...

405
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,068
because, well,
he tells me things

406
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,740
that I didn't previously know.

407
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,143
For example...

408
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,113
your name isn't Susan.

409
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,053
It's Hope Van Dyne.

410
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:53,160
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

411
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:55,098
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

412
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,049
What do you want?

413
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,386
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

414
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,591
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

415
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,228
Our relationship?

416
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,168
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

417
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,903
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

418
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:18,209
but now, Hank Pym...

419
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,478
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

420
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,915
Do you have a point?

421
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,184
Oh, you think
that I don't know

422
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,524
what you've been building
with all this?

423
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:28,229
Quantum technology.

424
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:30,867
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

425
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,003
forget cryptocurrency.

426
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,940
Quantum energy is the future.

427
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,610
It's the next gold rush.

428
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:36,577
Is that so?

429
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,549
I want in, Hope.

430
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,189
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

431
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,060
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

432
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:44,830
Starting bid...

433
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,937
one billion dollars.

434
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,507
Thank you, Sonny, really.

435
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,009
But my father and I
have something

436
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,382
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

437
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:57,688
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

438
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,894
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

439
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:03,231
So, we are either
in business together...

440
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,538
or we aren't
in business together.

441
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,546
Then I guess we aren't.

442
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,251
You can go.

443
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:16,057
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

444
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,396
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

445
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,100
Listen, Sonny.

446
00:24:21,102 --> 00:24:23,739
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

447
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,442
if you just give me
that component.

448
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:27,513
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

449
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:31,122
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

450
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,927
Okay.

451
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:43,779
So, now what?

452
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,182
You'll see.

453
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,121
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

454
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:49,288
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

455
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,325
because if they're not
working with us...

456
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:51,763
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

457
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:53,163
I want some names...

458
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,379
Hold on,
you gave her wings?

459
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,592
Get her.

460
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,562
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

461
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:30,708
Stop firing! Stop!

462
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:36,785
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

463
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,423
Go!

464
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,918
Wings and blasters.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,853
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

466
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:45,657
No, I did.

467
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,599
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

468
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,304
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

469
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:54,540
I can assure you of that!

470
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,859
What in the hell is that?

471
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:19,456
Dad,
are you seeing this?

472
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,460
Hope, get out of there!

473
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,546
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

474
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:39,364
It is still
a work in progress.

475
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,134
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

476
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,705
Yeah, great form.

477
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:02,641
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

478
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,077
Not the time, Scott.

479
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,081
Damn it, where'd it go?

480
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,189
I've lost it.

481
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:11,057
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

482
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,996
<i>Try looking...</i>

483
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:13,999
Dad?

484
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,518
Give me that.

485
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,522
Now.

486
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,132
- Are you okay?
- No!

487
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:32,200
He got the lab.

488
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:33,603
No.

489
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:34,607
Come on!

490
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,179
What was that?

491
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:39,783
I don't know.

492
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,719
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

493
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,557
and figure out
where the lab is.

494
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,894
So, where to now?

495
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:47,698
How about my house? Hmm?

496
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,867
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

497
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,069
and Woo could walk in
any second.

498
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:52,240
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

499
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:53,644
What about your house?

500
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,682
Sorry.

501
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:59,190
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

502
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:01,125
No.

503
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,998
No, no, no, no!

504
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:06,738
No!

505
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:11,712
Wow, Dr. Pym...

506
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:13,115
who would've thought that,

507
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,584
once again,
in your hour of need...

508
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,721
that you would turn to us,
you know?

509
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:17,725
Not me.

510
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:20,263
Mmm. Help yourself.

511
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:21,331
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

512
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,001
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

513
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:24,972
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

514
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:25,941
The oatmeal packets.

515
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:27,911
Oatmeal packets.

516
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,648
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

517
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,816
Because it tastes
like sand.

518
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,286
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

519
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,756
It's not organic,
it's sand.

520
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:34,792
It's the most important meal
of the day.

521
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:35,826
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

522
00:29:35,828 --> 00:29:37,096
Break teeth.

523
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:37,965
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

524
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:38,767
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

525
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,607
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

526
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,244
We got bigger fish to fry.

527
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:45,981
Is that my desk?

528
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:47,817
- Yeah.
- What?

529
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,254
Why do I have
such a small desk?

530
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:50,757
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

531
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,825
You snooze, you lose.

532
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:52,929
Well, I was
under house arrest.

533
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:53,965
Yeah.

534
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:54,965
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

535
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,267
This is garbage.

536
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,007
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

537
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:00,411
I got it at a rummage sale.

538
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:01,879
So, you save money
on my desk?

539
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,114
Guys.

540
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:05,285
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

541
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:07,290
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

542
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,028
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

543
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,230
like what happened to you.

544
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,235
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

545
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:15,105
Like a ghost.

546
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,811
Like Baba Yaga.

547
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:22,720
Baba Yaga, the witch.

548
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:25,094
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

549
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,664
You know Baba Yaga?

550
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:30,303
Whoever stole it...

551
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,038
we need to find it.

552
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,814
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

553
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:37,918
Like Baba Yaga.

554
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,456
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

555
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,027
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

556
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,197
Because if you didn't,

557
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,334
we have a variety
of affordable options.

558
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:50,042
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

559
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:52,748
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

560
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,484
They also looked like
they were phasing.

561
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,853
Phasing?

562
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,490
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

563
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:59,026
through different states
of matter.

564
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:00,830
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

565
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:01,931
The lab emits radiation.

566
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:05,037
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

567
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,777
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

568
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,347
Where else can we find
that equipment?

569
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,123
Well, there is one person.

570
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,860
Bill Foster.

571
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,062
Great!

572
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:18,799
Who's Bill Foster?

573
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,870
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

574
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:22,940
They had a falling out
years ago.

575
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,812
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

576
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:26,949
It's probably
just a waste of time.

577
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,885
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

578
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,353
Don't you think
we should check?

579
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,392
We need to find out
who took the lab.

580
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,667
Guys,
it's not a good idea

581
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:28,270
to be out in the open
like this.

582
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:31,443
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

583
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:33,614
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

584
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,352
That's not
a disguise, Hank.

585
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,555
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

586
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,994
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

587
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:44,536
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

588
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:46,574
If the system
is interfered with,

589
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:50,081
that stability becomes chaos.

590
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,084
Unpredictable.

591
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:55,090
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

592
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,094
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

593
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:59,632
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

594
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:03,341
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

595
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:06,013
In other words,
the object in question

596
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:07,649
would be both
in and out of phase...

597
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,657
with multiple
parallel realities.

598
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:19,739
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

599
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:22,644
I am noticing
an unusually high number

600
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:24,816
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

601
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,123
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

602
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,393
That'll be enough for today.

603
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,731
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

604
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:37,674
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

605
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:40,113
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

606
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:42,117
Posner molecules
in your brains.

607
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,321
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

608
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,391
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

609
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:46,459
in front of everything?

610
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,197
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

611
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,599
Hope, I'd love
to help you...

612
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,734
but I don't have anything

613
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:51,902
like the equipment
you're describing.

614
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,842
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

615
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:55,376
Don't condescend, Hank.

616
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,547
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

617
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,451
All because
you had to grow to a size

618
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,323
that finally fit your ego.

619
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:04,527
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

620
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:05,531
Really?

621
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,606
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

622
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:11,775
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

623
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,246
Actually, I do.

624
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:14,883
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

625
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,786
on a project called Goliath.

626
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,488
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

627
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,528
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

628
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,632
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

629
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:23,769
Right...

630
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:28,478
I don't know.
How big did you get?

631
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,182
My record? 21 feet.

632
00:34:31,184 --> 00:34:32,517
- Not bad.
- You?

633
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,619
I don't...

634
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:34,623
No, really, I'm curious.

635
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:37,528
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

636
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,499
- Huge.
- 65.

637
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:42,204
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

638
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,374
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

639
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,514
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

640
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,385
Strange.

641
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,289
You had all the answers
back in the day.

642
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,657
That's why
I left the project.

643
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,728
Left? I fired you.

644
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,298
Best decision
I ever made.

645
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,537
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

646
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:00,807
stubborn, impatient.

647
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,746
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

648
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:04,414
Just the mediocrities.

649
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,586
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

650
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,554
and chose to stick it out.

651
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:08,923
Watch it, Bill.

652
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:10,494
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

653
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:11,563
You son of a bitch.

654
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,932
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

655
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,670
I'm trying to
save my mother.

656
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,342
Now, which office
would you say?

657
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:19,346
Oh, it's Woo.

658
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:21,849
Someone must have seen me.

659
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:23,385
Relax.
If this is about you,

660
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,789
they'd be in your house
by now.

661
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,764
What are you, 15?

662
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:29,900
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

663
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:33,606
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

664
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:34,641
if you modify
the diffraction units

665
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:36,378
on one of your regulators.

666
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,550
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

667
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,356
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,445
But, Doctor,
campus police says

669
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,349
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

670
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,719
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

671
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,722
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

672
00:35:58,724 --> 00:35:59,659
I can assure you
I'm the last person

673
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:00,927
he would want to visit.

674
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:01,862
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

675
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:02,866
Hey, hey.

676
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,434
Why is that?

677
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,940
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

678
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:10,813
So I'm a terrible partner?

679
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,083
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

680
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:14,653
in his unremarkable career.

681
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:16,592
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

682
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:18,729
Fine, one decent idea.

683
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,666
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

684
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:22,372
when I upgraded the suits.

685
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:27,079
So, if we had an old suit,

686
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,517
we might be able
to track down the lab?

687
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,655
Yes, but we don't.

688
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,762
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

689
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,067
I mean...

690
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,804
life's funny.

691
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,641
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

692
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:42,976
What?

693
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:45,450
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

694
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,653
I couldn't destroy that.

695
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,525
Before I turned myself in,

696
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:50,860
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

697
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:53,630
You sent my suit
through the mail?

698
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,503
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

699
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,775
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

700
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:00,144
Where is it?

701
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:02,717
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

702
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,523
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

703
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:06,925
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

704
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:08,561
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

705
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:10,030
Hey, get away from the plant.

706
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:11,804
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

707
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:14,574
Show-and-tell.

708
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:15,577
Scotty?

709
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:19,517
No, stop!

710
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,588
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

711
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:29,637
Whenever you go
back to school...

712
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,307
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

713
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:32,809
This place seems huge.

714
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:34,012
<i>What is it?</i>

715
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,248
It's the new regulator.

716
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,251
Hank, what's
going on with this suit?

717
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,023
How much of
a work in progress is this?

718
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:43,664
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

719
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:52,885
Oh.

720
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,858
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

721
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,129
Okay, okay.

722
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:04,072
<i>What do you see?</i>

723
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,144
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

724
00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:07,847
Just let me...

725
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:09,184
Ow!

726
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,155
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

727
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,165
Okay. All right.

728
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,103
Try that.

729
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,213
Sorry.

730
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:26,218
What?

731
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,425
Awesome.

732
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:33,764
If only Cap could see you now.

733
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,368
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

734
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,925
Hey!

735
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,063
Where's your hall pass?

736
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:52,371
Hey, I'm talking to you.

737
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:55,074
Hey!

738
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:58,081
Hey. Eh...

739
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:24,967
You can do it.

740
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:27,072
You almost got it.

741
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, peanut.

742
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,994
Okay, let's go.

743
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,262
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

744
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,871
All right, get your jokes out now.
Can you fix the suit?

745
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,505
So cranky.

746
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:21,146
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

747
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:23,184
Do you really have that?

748
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,205
Let's see
if Foster was right.

749
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,170
This has gotta be the lab.

750
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,476
Let's go get it.

751
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:55,480
Yeah.

752
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,235
This seems right.

753
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,978
Look at us, teaming
up twice in one day.

754
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,612
Makes you think, huh?

755
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:13,648
About what?

756
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,554
Germany.

757
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,523
What do you mean?

758
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:19,561
We were working together,
training together...

759
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,568
and other stuffing together.

760
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,673
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

761
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:26,376
I guess we'll never know.

762
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:27,776
But I do know one thing.

763
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,347
What?

764
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,720
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

765
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:41,472
Hey, Scott.

766
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:43,610
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

767
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,280
long enough to get my lab?

768
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:47,119
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

769
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:54,465
Okay, you're transmitting.

770
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:55,666
What took you so long?

771
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:58,271
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

772
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,376
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

773
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:02,179
You like it?

774
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,349
Hilarious.

775
00:42:04,452 --> 00:42:06,488
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

776
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,592
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

777
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,795
<i>Be careful.</i>

778
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:10,664
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

779
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,503
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

780
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:15,708
- How do you know?
- Look.

781
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,217
That's Ghost?

782
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:22,487
What is she doing?

783
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:23,655
Do you think
that suit is how

784
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:25,793
she goes through walls
and stuff?

785
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:27,664
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

786
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,637
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

787
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,550
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

788
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:38,751
and not
somebody else's, right?

789
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:40,657
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

790
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,862
I'll get it.

791
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,168
Oh, shit...

792
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,197
Hope. Hope! Hank.

793
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:03,267
Guys.

794
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,507
I don't think
they can hear you.

795
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:09,347
Hi.

796
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:11,418
I'm Ava.

797
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:12,888
Scott.

798
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,896
So, you don't
need the suit...

799
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,803
to go through things.

800
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:23,307
No.

801
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,447
It just helps me control it.

802
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:31,724
And the pain, supposedly.

803
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:37,769
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

804
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:39,005
and crush my heart, are you?

805
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,317
You're funny.

806
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,231
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

807
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:54,439
I need...

808
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,612
what's in your head.

809
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:13,441
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

810
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,478
and get this over with,
shall we?

811
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:18,518
Get up!

812
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,322
Come on!

813
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,030
Dad?

814
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:28,637
Don't ever touch him again.

815
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:29,808
Now, now, Hope...

816
00:44:31,077 --> 00:44:32,679
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

817
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:33,715
all things considered.

818
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:36,623
What the hell
are you talking about?

819
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:40,628
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

820
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,001
Bill.

821
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:46,673
What have you done?

822
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:49,380
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

823
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,416
You're with her?

824
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:53,820
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

825
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:55,825
What the hell
is going on here?

826
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,831
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

827
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,668
Why would he?

828
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,539
Elihas Starr.

829
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:06,079
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

830
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,615
Quantum research.

831
00:45:08,617 --> 00:45:12,758
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

832
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,561
You had him fired.

833
00:45:14,563 --> 00:45:16,433
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

834
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:23,715
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

835
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:28,155
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

836
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:29,159
No, no, no!

837
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,197
Too many.

838
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,570
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

839
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:37,041
He told us to run.

840
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:38,008
Elihas, what's happening?

841
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,778
Just go. Go!

842
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,184
Daddy! Daddy!

843
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:43,454
<i>I could tell
he was scared.</i>

844
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,865
Daddy!

845
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:50,969
Ava, no!

846
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,012
<i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i>

847
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,751
No! No!

848
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:08,771
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

849
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,246
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

850
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:21,030
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i>

851
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:24,635
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

852
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:27,842
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

853
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:31,749
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

854
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:33,086
and stitched back together.

855
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:35,958
Over and over.

856
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,597
Every day.

857
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,103
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

858
00:46:41,105 --> 00:46:43,608
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

859
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:47,784
Hello, Ava.

860
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,688
My name's Bill.

861
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,159
I was a friend
of your father's.

862
00:46:55,331 --> 00:46:56,634
I brought you something.

863
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:03,280
It's all right.
Try again.

864
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:06,851
That's it.

865
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:09,125
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

866
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,795
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

867
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:14,001
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

868
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:19,144
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

869
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:21,481
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

870
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:22,985
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

871
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:25,358
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

872
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,295
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

873
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:32,104
<i>Killed for them.</i>

874
00:47:32,106 --> 00:47:34,307
And in exchange
for my soul...

875
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,047
they were going to cure me.

876
00:47:39,385 --> 00:47:41,157
They lied.

877
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:45,229
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

878
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:47,099
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

879
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,469
but her condition
was progressive.

880
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:49,873
I didn't know how to cure it.

881
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:54,079
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

882
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,483
and that she should
watch you instead.

883
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:57,019
And sure enough,
she discovered

884
00:47:57,021 --> 00:47:58,322
that you were
building the tunnel.

885
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,563
Then, she told me
about Lang.

886
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:05,103
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

887
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:06,472
that's when I...

888
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:07,807
Christ's sake!

889
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,276
That's me. I'm sorry.

890
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:10,880
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

891
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,586
"Cassie, 911."

892
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,889
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

893
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,293
No, that's not happening.

894
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,363
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

895
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:21,166
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

896
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:23,204
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

897
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:26,077
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

898
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,950
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

899
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:33,425
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

900
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:35,061
<i>I can't find
my soccer shoes.</i>

901
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:36,430
What?

902
00:48:36,432 --> 00:48:37,499
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

903
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,469
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

904
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,440
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

905
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:41,976
No, I can't
do that right now.

906
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:44,079
- <i>Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.

907
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:44,849
<i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i>

908
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:46,115
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

909
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:47,420
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

910
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:48,990
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

911
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,927
- Bye, peanut!
- <i>Feel better!</i>

912
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,295
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

913
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:55,135
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

914
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:56,972
Ava, I want to help you.

915
00:48:56,974 --> 00:48:59,142
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

916
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,311
Oh, really? How?

917
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,949
Janet.

918
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,217
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

919
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:04,353
absorbing quantum energy.

920
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,090
We can extract that energy.

921
00:49:06,092 --> 00:49:08,193
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

922
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,362
Extract it?

923
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,432
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

924
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,369
That would rip
Janet apart.

925
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:15,340
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

926
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:16,679
When Janet's location

927
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:18,048
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

928
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,717
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

929
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,054
What?

930
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:22,990
You are gonna
stay here...

931
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:24,594
just in case
I need your help.

932
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:27,498
Like hell
I would help you!

933
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,635
You'll do whatever I say.

934
00:49:28,637 --> 00:49:30,037
You're gonna kill Janet!

935
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,041
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

936
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:34,981
Goddamn it, Bill!

937
00:49:34,983 --> 00:49:36,218
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

938
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,122
So help me God...

939
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:40,191
The pills.

940
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:42,061
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

941
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,534
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

942
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:47,405
He could die!

943
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:48,474
Come on!

944
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:50,077
Help him!

945
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,514
Dad, just hang on,
all right?

946
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:52,782
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

947
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,320
Help him, man! Come on!

948
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:55,123
The Altoid tin!

949
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:58,295
Wait!

950
00:50:02,538 --> 00:50:03,539
Thanks, guys.

951
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:05,509
Hank!

952
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,405
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

953
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:24,079
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

954
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,316
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

955
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,222
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

956
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:31,693
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

957
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,697
Good job.

958
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,333
It'll work.

959
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:36,670
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

960
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:38,106
Look, we'll adjust the relays

961
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:39,675
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

962
00:50:39,677 --> 00:50:41,279
It's going to be fine.

963
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:48,561
So, this is it.

964
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:50,599
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

965
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:52,300
to prepare
I'd be more ready.

966
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,407
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

967
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,746
It kind of melts your mind.

968
00:50:57,748 --> 00:50:59,585
I mean seeing my mom again.

969
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:00,719
Oh.

970
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:05,159
What if she's a completely
different person?

971
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:07,565
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

972
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:08,735
I'm serious, Scott.

973
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,107
Or George Jefferson.

974
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,782
What if she's forgotten
about me?

975
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:18,586
When I was in prison...

976
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:21,291
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

977
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:22,729
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

978
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:23,867
I never would have
forgotten her.

979
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,438
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

980
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,177
until she can see you again.

981
00:51:31,782 --> 00:51:32,750
Thank you.

982
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,633
Hey.

983
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:42,735
We got a big problem.

984
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:43,804
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

985
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:44,940
on the back of the building.

986
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,742
Oh, no.

987
00:51:46,744 --> 00:51:48,347
And they're on the proposal,

988
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:49,816
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

989
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:54,325
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

990
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:55,927
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

991
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:56,896
No. No, no, no, no.

992
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:58,532
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

993
00:51:58,534 --> 00:51:59,936
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

994
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:02,307
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

995
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:03,376
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

996
00:52:03,378 --> 00:52:05,847
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

997
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:07,418
And you can fix them there.

998
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,619
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

999
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:09,789
It's complicated.

1000
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:10,893
What do you mean
it's complicated?

1001
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,505
As you can see, sir,

1002
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:19,708
this system
is state of the art.

1003
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,945
Security of tomorrow, today.

1004
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:23,383
Oh, that's so good!

1005
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:24,851
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

1006
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:25,987
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1007
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,057
so we can fix the plans.

1008
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:28,860
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1009
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:31,932
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

1010
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,737
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1011
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:35,441
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

1012
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,775
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

1013
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:38,546
Well, you said
get the works.

1014
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:40,583
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1015
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:41,553
He's right.

1016
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:44,726
The undercarriage wash,

1017
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,394
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

1018
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:49,769
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1019
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:50,838
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

1020
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,841
about car wash protocol?

1021
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:54,711
Well, my name
is Sonny Burch.

1022
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,018
And I do my research, Luis.

1023
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:01,927
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

1024
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,829
at the FBI that you are

1025
00:53:03,831 --> 00:53:05,633
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

1026
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:08,773
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

1027
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:11,577
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

1028
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,916
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

1029
00:53:13,918 --> 00:53:16,856
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

1030
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:18,492
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

1031
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:21,063
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1032
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,903
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

1033
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:26,943
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1034
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:30,585
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1035
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,488
Now...

1036
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,226
Uzman is a master

1037
00:53:35,228 --> 00:53:37,630
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

1038
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,900
through psychoactive means.

1039
00:53:40,905 --> 00:53:43,007
Oh, is that truth serum?

1040
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:44,979
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

1041
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:46,682
That's just nonsense
from TV.

1042
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:48,485
Well, what is it then?

1043
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:50,155
It's a little concoction

1044
00:53:50,157 --> 00:53:52,961
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1045
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,867
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1046
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:56,735
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

1047
00:53:56,737 --> 00:53:58,104
No, it's not.

1048
00:53:58,106 --> 00:54:01,077
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1049
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,282
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

1050
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:04,985
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1051
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:06,021
It's not a truth serum.

1052
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:09,626
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1053
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,030
The truth serum.

1054
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,967
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

1055
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,606
so you might wanna think
about that.

1056
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:19,548
We've got to get
that lab back.

1057
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,686
What?

1058
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:24,824
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1059
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:27,999
How long have I got?

1060
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,108
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1061
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,782
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1062
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:38,786
How?

1063
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,360
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

1064
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,362
You can't mean that.

1065
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:44,965
Ava!

1066
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,106
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

1067
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,745
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

1068
00:54:51,646 --> 00:54:52,746
You're not the one
who's about

1069
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,284
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

1070
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:55,320
I am!

1071
00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:57,992
You said
you could fix me!

1072
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:02,700
You promised.

1073
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:04,704
I know. I will.

1074
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:06,008
But not like that.

1075
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:11,083
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

1076
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:13,356
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1077
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:20,804
Fine.

1078
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,744
There are other options.

1079
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,941
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1080
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:41,342
Because I don't
feel anything.

1081
00:55:41,344 --> 00:55:43,081
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1082
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,217
This is truth serum!

1083
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:45,385
There's no such thing!

1084
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:47,088
Okay.

1085
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,425
Okay, okay.

1086
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:51,898
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1087
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,102
Okay.

1088
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:59,045
Where is Scott Lang?

1089
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,215
Well, see,
that's complicated.

1090
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:02,284
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1091
00:56:02,286 --> 00:56:03,688
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

1092
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,023
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

1093
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:07,362
<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

1094
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,597
<i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i>

1095
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,300
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

1096
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:10,235
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

1097
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:12,805
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

1098
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:13,474
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

1099
00:56:13,476 --> 00:56:14,610
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i>

1100
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:15,644
<i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i>

1101
00:56:15,646 --> 00:56:16,347
<i>"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i>

1102
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:18,418
Okay,
hold on, hold on.

1103
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,121
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

1104
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:21,123
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1105
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,325
with where Scott Lang is?

1106
00:56:22,327 --> 00:56:23,494
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1107
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:25,030
You put a dime in him,

1108
00:56:25,032 --> 00:56:26,233
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

1109
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:28,304
He like human jukebox.

1110
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:29,940
Oh, my <i>abuelita</i> had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1111
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:31,141
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

1112
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:33,847
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

1113
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:36,586
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i>

1114
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:37,923
<i>Then</i>, ¡adios!

1115
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:39,191
What can I say?
We relate to his

1116
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:40,894
melancholy ballads,
you know?

1117
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:42,130
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

1118
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,166
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

1119
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:44,436
and he starts working
for Hank.

1120
00:56:44,438 --> 00:56:45,369
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

1121
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:47,309
<i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i>

1122
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:49,045
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

1123
00:56:49,047 --> 00:56:50,280
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1124
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,349
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

1125
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,385
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

1126
00:56:52,387 --> 00:56:53,119
<i>"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i>

1127
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,191
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

1128
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:55,891
<i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i>

1129
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:57,028
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1130
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,162
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

1131
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,568
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i>

1132
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,104
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

1133
00:57:02,106 --> 00:57:03,541
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

1134
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:04,876
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

1135
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:05,878
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

1136
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,115
<i>"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been</i>

1137
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:10,052
<i>"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i>

1138
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:11,188
<i>But fate brought 'em
back together.</i>

1139
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,291
And then Hope's heart
is all...

1140
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:13,628
<i>"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...</i>

1141
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,664
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

1142
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,833
And then
my heart is all, like...

1143
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:19,070
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

1144
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:20,641
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

1145
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:21,508
"Out of business"?

1146
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,646
"Days away"?

1147
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,215
Damn truth serum!

1148
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,286
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

1149
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,222
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

1150
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:29,025
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

1151
00:57:29,027 --> 00:57:30,226
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

1152
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:31,396
That's terrible bossing!

1153
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:32,563
Damn, bro!

1154
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:33,367
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

1155
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:36,340
Enough.

1156
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:40,316
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1157
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:43,253
Where is Scott Lang?

1158
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:44,255
I've been trying to tell you,

1159
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:45,523
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

1160
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:47,226
Emotionally speaking.

1161
00:57:47,228 --> 00:57:50,233
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1162
00:57:50,235 --> 00:57:51,670
Oh! The woods.

1163
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:52,507
The woods?

1164
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:54,210
Baba Yaga!

1165
00:57:55,445 --> 00:57:57,280
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1166
00:57:57,282 --> 00:57:58,450
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

1167
00:57:58,452 --> 00:57:59,753
off the Panoramic Highway!

1168
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,222
For God's sake!

1169
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:04,729
<i>♪ Baba Yaga,
come at night</i>

1170
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,969
<i>♪ Little children,
sleepy tight ♪</i>

1171
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,675
Damn it!

1172
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,081
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

1173
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,784
I'm never gonna see it.

1174
00:58:15,786 --> 00:58:16,653
So, what do we do now?

1175
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:19,758
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

1176
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,295
than from the boogeyman.

1177
00:58:23,802 --> 00:58:27,273
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

1178
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:31,148
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1179
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,284
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1180
00:58:32,286 --> 00:58:34,387
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1181
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,259
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1182
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,364
Understood.

1183
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,501
Good news, gentlemen.

1184
00:58:41,503 --> 00:58:44,340
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1185
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:46,278
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1186
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,282
Right.

1187
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:52,557
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

1188
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,030
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1189
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,170
Ooh, I love leads.

1190
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,150
System's in the green.

1191
00:59:06,152 --> 00:59:07,554
Priming the coils.

1192
00:59:10,128 --> 00:59:11,327
Full charge.

1193
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:12,498
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1194
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,633
let us know
if you get anything

1195
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:14,802
that could be
a part of her message.

1196
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:16,139
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1197
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:19,612
Okay, then.

1198
00:59:22,418 --> 00:59:23,420
Here it goes.

1199
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:38,684
We did it!

1200
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:40,753
You got anything?

1201
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:45,563
Nothin'.

1202
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:47,768
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1203
00:59:49,271 --> 00:59:50,807
No.

1204
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:52,409
No, no, no, no!

1205
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:53,445
What's happening?

1206
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:55,648
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1207
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,854
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1208
00:59:57,856 --> 00:59:59,224
Then what else
could it be?

1209
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:00,628
I don't know!

1210
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,273
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

1211
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,644
Scott, you can't...

1212
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:11,280
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1213
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:12,485
I need to fix the algorithm.

1214
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:16,992
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1215
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:18,664
I've thought about it a lot.

1216
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:24,375
Janet?

1217
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,416
Hi, honey.

1218
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:33,561
Jellybean.

1219
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:35,330
Mom?

1220
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:37,932
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1221
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,072
It's all so rushed.

1222
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,510
You two have done
such great work.

1223
01:00:42,512 --> 01:00:44,481
You just need a little...

1224
01:00:44,715 --> 01:00:46,018
nudge.

1225
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,720
Janet,
how is this possible?

1226
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,958
It wasn't a message you put

1227
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,461
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1228
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:10,465
Clever girl.

1229
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,670
I'm so proud of you.

1230
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,541
Honey, tell us where you are.

1231
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,510
Tell us how to find you.

1232
01:01:16,512 --> 01:01:18,514
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1233
01:01:18,516 --> 01:01:19,816
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1234
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:21,054
You have to follow my voice.

1235
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:22,923
Of course!

1236
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:24,595
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1237
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:33,043
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1238
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:35,449
between point two
and point nine.

1239
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,151
I'd narrow it
to four and six.

1240
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:38,454
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1241
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:39,826
Look at us squabbling again.

1242
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:43,865
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1243
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:46,972
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1244
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:03,137
Bullseye.

1245
01:02:03,773 --> 01:02:05,041
Source lock.

1246
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:07,010
It's you.

1247
01:02:07,012 --> 01:02:09,782
We got it!

1248
01:02:09,784 --> 01:02:11,854
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1249
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:14,525
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1250
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,760
It's very dangerous,

1251
01:02:15,762 --> 01:02:17,967
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1252
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:20,670
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1253
01:02:20,672 --> 01:02:22,208
You have two hours.

1254
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,012
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1255
01:02:24,014 --> 01:02:25,081
and it'll be another century

1256
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:26,717
before they align
like this again.

1257
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:28,522
We'll find you.

1258
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,574
I know you will,
Jellybean.

1259
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:43,784
Nope.

1260
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:45,789
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1261
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:46,626
Perfect.

1262
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:50,097
How did we get up here?

1263
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:57,077
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1264
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,280
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1265
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:01,052
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1266
01:03:01,054 --> 01:03:03,123
Scott, I'll be fine.

1267
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,325
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1268
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:05,927
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1269
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,705
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1270
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:13,644
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

1271
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:15,615
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1272
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:17,651
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1273
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:19,088
- What?
- <i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1274
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,090
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1275
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:21,392
And then all of a sudden

1276
01:03:21,394 --> 01:03:22,494
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1277
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:24,398
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1278
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,300
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

1279
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,336
- Uh...
- <i>But you need to go home...</i>

1280
01:03:26,338 --> 01:03:28,106
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1281
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,309
And by the way...

1282
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:31,914
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1283
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:43,269
I feel like such a jerk.

1284
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,675
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1285
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:46,842
What?

1286
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,847
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1287
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:50,316
How?

1288
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:52,421
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

1289
01:03:52,423 --> 01:03:53,090
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1290
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:54,793
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1291
01:03:54,795 --> 01:03:56,463
Oh, my God!

1292
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,999
Look, we need
to land that account.

1293
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,267
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

1294
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,170
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1295
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,271
to find work these days?

1296
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:02,643
Jesus, Scott!

1297
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:13,996
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1298
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:15,767
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1299
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:16,936
I know!

1300
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:19,208
I'm really sorry...

1301
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,912
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1302
01:04:21,914 --> 01:04:23,183
I have to go.

1303
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:26,826
Can I borrow the suit?

1304
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:29,697
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

1305
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:31,766
<i>Powering on.</i>

1306
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:34,104
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

1307
01:04:34,106 --> 01:04:36,242
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1308
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:37,943
- Don't bother.
- What?

1309
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:39,115
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1310
01:04:39,117 --> 01:04:40,383
as soon as
we've found my mom.

1311
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:42,355
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

1312
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,927
- Scott?
- Daddy?

1313
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:03,162
It's us, buddy!

1314
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:05,566
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1315
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,070
He must be resting.

1316
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:08,238
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

1317
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,307
and look under your bed?

1318
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:11,478
Daddy, you upstairs?

1319
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,050
Daddy?

1320
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:16,257
What the...

1321
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:20,028
He really lives
like a pig these days.

1322
01:05:23,237 --> 01:05:24,405
Daddy?

1323
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:34,123
Spread out!

1324
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,293
Again?

1325
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:37,095
You people have no shame!

1326
01:05:37,097 --> 01:05:38,532
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1327
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:39,536
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1328
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,411
Cassie, let the man get by!

1329
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:46,280
But Daddy's super sick!

1330
01:05:46,282 --> 01:05:47,650
I'll see about that!

1331
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,521
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1332
01:05:49,523 --> 01:05:51,258
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1333
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,496
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1334
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:55,132
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

1335
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:56,936
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1336
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,106
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1337
01:05:59,108 --> 01:06:00,611
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

1338
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,014
No!

1339
01:06:05,422 --> 01:06:07,557
Woo!

1340
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:11,298
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

1341
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,673
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

1342
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:16,977
I told you.

1343
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,612
Excuse me.

1344
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:21,050
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1345
01:06:21,052 --> 01:06:22,753
Sorry.

1346
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:30,735
I'll start the van.

1347
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,674
You get the lab.

1348
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:37,217
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1349
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:53,115
Hank Pym...

1350
01:06:53,117 --> 01:06:54,516
Hope Van Dyne...

1351
01:06:54,518 --> 01:06:55,686
you're under arrest.

1352
01:06:57,557 --> 01:06:58,724
This is harassment!

1353
01:06:58,726 --> 01:07:00,229
Actually, it's not.

1354
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,664
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1355
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:04,037
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

1356
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:07,543
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

1357
01:07:08,179 --> 01:07:09,746
Damn it!

1358
01:07:09,748 --> 01:07:12,286
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1359
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,190
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1360
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,529
Seriously? Yes!

1361
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:19,867
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1362
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,371
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1363
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:24,309
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1364
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:25,744
Anyway, I'll be back later

1365
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:27,583
for the official end
of your sentence!

1366
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,286
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1367
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:31,125
You should feel great
about yourself!

1368
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:56,307
What is it?

1369
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:57,476
We have a man down.

1370
01:07:57,478 --> 01:07:58,847
And Pym's lab is gone.

1371
01:08:07,297 --> 01:08:08,298
Hey.

1372
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:12,271
Thanks for covering for me.

1373
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:12,908
Sure.

1374
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,817
So...

1375
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:20,423
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1376
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:25,831
Not long.

1377
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,669
It just sort of happened.

1378
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:29,706
I'm sorry
for lying to you...

1379
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,509
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1380
01:08:31,511 --> 01:08:32,478
Daddy, it's okay.

1381
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,615
It's not.

1382
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:36,352
I do some dumb things...

1383
01:08:36,354 --> 01:08:38,625
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1384
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:39,793
Mainly you.

1385
01:08:39,795 --> 01:08:42,330
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1386
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,874
I screw it up
just about every time.

1387
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:50,280
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1388
01:08:50,282 --> 01:08:51,583
like a partner.

1389
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:52,486
Well, she's made it clear

1390
01:08:52,488 --> 01:08:53,987
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1391
01:08:53,989 --> 01:08:55,290
Who?

1392
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:56,560
Hope.

1393
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,366
Wait, who did you think?

1394
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,371
Me.

1395
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:03,339
You?

1396
01:09:03,341 --> 01:09:05,311
Don't laugh.

1397
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:06,545
I'd be a great partner.

1398
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:08,616
Aw, peanut.

1399
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:12,892
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1400
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:14,930
I would be a terrible dad.

1401
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,967
Fine.

1402
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,640
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1403
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:22,847
She reminds me of you.

1404
01:09:23,548 --> 01:09:25,884
You gonna go help her?

1405
01:09:25,886 --> 01:09:27,856
I think you should help her.

1406
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:30,893
I wish I could...

1407
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:33,567
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1408
01:09:36,908 --> 01:09:38,843
You can do it.

1409
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:41,449
You can do anything.

1410
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:44,388
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1411
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,772
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1412
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:55,910
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1413
01:09:55,912 --> 01:09:57,981
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1414
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:08,036
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1415
01:10:14,684 --> 01:10:16,588
All right,
what's our plan?

1416
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,527
To shrink that wall.

1417
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:21,696
It looks load-bearing.

1418
01:10:21,698 --> 01:10:22,865
The ceiling could collapse.

1419
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:24,701
Then we run like hell.

1420
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:27,072
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1421
01:10:27,074 --> 01:10:28,876
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1422
01:10:28,878 --> 01:10:30,513
They're all heavily armed.

1423
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:31,450
Not great odds.

1424
01:10:32,152 --> 01:10:33,251
You got any better ideas?

1425
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:34,456
Nope.

1426
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:37,794
And I'm not
giving up on Mom.

1427
01:10:37,796 --> 01:10:39,131
She'd be so proud of you.

1428
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:45,745
Okay.

1429
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:48,051
One...

1430
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:49,687
two...

1431
01:10:54,863 --> 01:10:56,298
Scott?

1432
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,835
What're you two
just standing around for?

1433
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,105
We gotta go find that lab.

1434
01:11:00,074 --> 01:11:01,077
What about me?

1435
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:04,179
Perfect.

1436
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,717
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1437
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:20,680
Okay, now what?

1438
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:22,051
You're asking me?

1439
01:11:24,855 --> 01:11:26,024
Get in!

1440
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,171
Hi.

1441
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:33,974
Hi.

1442
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:40,117
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1443
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:42,055
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1444
01:11:42,057 --> 01:11:44,294
until they start shooting
at us?

1445
01:11:44,296 --> 01:11:45,698
Yeah.

1446
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:51,875
- Hey, Burch.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1447
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:53,044
Yeah, they're out.

1448
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:54,181
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1449
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:00,759
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1450
01:12:00,761 --> 01:12:02,062
How could this happen?

1451
01:12:02,064 --> 01:12:03,767
I mean, what the dickens?

1452
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,373
Thank you.

1453
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:09,378
You're welcome.

1454
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,053
So, uh, how do we find
the lab?

1455
01:12:14,055 --> 01:12:15,254
After we lost it
the first time...

1456
01:12:15,256 --> 01:12:18,227
I put on a new tracker...

1457
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:19,899
of sorts.

1458
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:30,152
That'll work.

1459
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,308
Is it ready or not?

1460
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,915
We can begin
the extraction process.

1461
01:13:02,985 --> 01:13:04,152
Listen, Ava.

1462
01:13:04,154 --> 01:13:05,858
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1463
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:08,027
Maybe we should...

1464
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:10,965
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1465
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:12,872
I've got days
until I'm dead.

1466
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,379
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1467
01:13:19,851 --> 01:13:23,089
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1468
01:13:23,091 --> 01:13:24,159
We don't have much time before

1469
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:25,428
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1470
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:28,134
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1471
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:29,436
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1472
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,440
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1473
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:32,976
So, we should do that.

1474
01:13:32,978 --> 01:13:35,249
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1475
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,887
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1476
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:40,191
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1477
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:42,595
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1478
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:44,299
Let's call it 2-A.

1479
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:46,001
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1480
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:47,371
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1481
01:13:47,373 --> 01:13:48,909
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1482
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:49,610
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1483
01:13:49,612 --> 01:13:51,112
Scott!

1484
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:52,014
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1485
01:13:52,016 --> 01:13:53,519
I'm going to dive.

1486
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,994
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1487
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:01,500
together,
protecting the tunnel.

1488
01:14:01,502 --> 01:14:03,906
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1489
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:07,280
Let me get her.

1490
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:10,519
I think he's right.

1491
01:14:17,668 --> 01:14:20,038
"Whassup?"

1492
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,548
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

1493
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,652
"Whassup?"

1494
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,057
I had him follow us.

1495
01:14:30,059 --> 01:14:32,529
I thought we could use
some help.

1496
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:35,601
All right.
I'm in position.

1497
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:37,103
The ants are headed in.

1498
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,406
<i>Copy that.</i>

1499
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:39,377
<i>Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.</i>

1500
01:14:40,112 --> 01:14:43,282
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

1501
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:45,254
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1502
01:14:45,256 --> 01:14:47,226
By the way, I love that suit!

1503
01:14:47,694 --> 01:14:49,331
Thanks, man.

1504
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:52,568
I wish I had a suit.

1505
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:57,076
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1506
01:14:57,078 --> 01:15:00,351
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1507
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:16,351
What is it?

1508
01:15:17,252 --> 01:15:19,189
Don't know.

1509
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:24,199
It's them!

1510
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,208
They can't be far.

1511
01:15:49,182 --> 01:15:52,387
All right, Hank. Hank?

1512
01:15:54,393 --> 01:15:56,195
Dad, what's your status?

1513
01:15:56,197 --> 01:15:57,865
Foster's taken care of.

1514
01:15:57,867 --> 01:15:59,436
Suiting up now.

1515
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:06,182
I just wanted to save Ava.

1516
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:08,785
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1517
01:16:08,787 --> 01:16:09,622
She's afraid.

1518
01:16:10,826 --> 01:16:13,729
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1519
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:15,633
I promise.

1520
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:18,139
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1521
01:16:20,244 --> 01:16:21,646
Good luck, Hank.

1522
01:16:22,349 --> 01:16:24,684
Thanks, Bill.

1523
01:16:24,686 --> 01:16:27,358
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1524
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:47,799
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

1525
01:16:49,537 --> 01:16:50,936
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

1526
01:16:50,938 --> 01:16:51,906
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1527
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:53,243
No, nothing yet.

1528
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:00,391
Ava!

1529
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:05,433
Call off the ants, Scott.

1530
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:06,404
Oh, boy!

1531
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:31,518
Can I get a status report?

1532
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,788
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1533
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:37,398
Ready to dive.

1534
01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:46,680
- In case I don't make it...
- <i>Don't.</i>

1535
01:17:46,682 --> 01:17:47,917
Don't say that.

1536
01:17:48,654 --> 01:17:50,656
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

1537
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:51,559
I love you, Hope.

1538
01:17:53,697 --> 01:17:55,700
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1539
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:12,835
Now.

1540
01:18:22,921 --> 01:18:24,558
Misdirection.

1541
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,925
One of the first things
they teach you

1542
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:28,099
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1543
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:31,072
No!

1544
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:35,948
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1545
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:38,218
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1546
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,821
Okay, on my way!

1547
01:18:39,823 --> 01:18:40,624
Oh, no.

1548
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,000
Really?
This guy again?

1549
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:48,236
Who?

1550
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:50,442
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1551
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:53,548
Change of plans.

1552
01:18:56,989 --> 01:18:57,992
Hang on.

1553
01:19:07,545 --> 01:19:09,548
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1554
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:20,002
Hold on.

1555
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,000
That undercarriage is filthy!

1556
01:19:36,002 --> 01:19:37,238
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1557
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:43,816
Hope, what're you doing?

1558
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:45,217
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1559
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:46,385
<i>Don't worry,</i>

1560
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:47,822
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

1561
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,694
Wait, what're you... Oh.

1562
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,572
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1563
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,641
We're gonna die!

1564
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,934
<i>Signal lost.</i>

1565
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:30,073
What the hell
are they doing up there?

1566
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:34,214
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1567
01:20:49,413 --> 01:20:51,184
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1568
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:56,159
You never said
it was so beautiful, Scott.

1569
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:02,907
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1570
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:09,117
Okay, any time now.

1571
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:11,155
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1572
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:15,464
- <i>Recalibrating.</i>
- Come on.

1573
01:21:16,435 --> 01:21:18,806
<i>Signal restored.</i>

1574
01:21:31,798 --> 01:21:33,167
Bikes, it's all you.

1575
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,511
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait! Whoa.

1576
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:51,969
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1577
01:21:51,971 --> 01:21:53,606
Be careful up there!

1578
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,512
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1579
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:26,942
Oh, you got pezed!

1580
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:29,880
Up here!

1581
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:34,356
Oh, that's not good.

1582
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:39,432
Hope!

1583
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,912
- No!
- No!

1584
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:52,590
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1585
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:53,627
Get the lab!

1586
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,983
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1587
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:10,157
Hope! Wait!

1588
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,461
Hey, what about me?

1589
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,582
We got you now, Ava!

1590
01:23:22,184 --> 01:23:24,620
Whoa! Oh!

1591
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:49,470
Not again!

1592
01:23:51,242 --> 01:23:52,478
Piece of junk!

1593
01:23:55,819 --> 01:23:57,321
Ah! Yes!

1594
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:01,261
Go, go, go, go, go!

1595
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,170
Burch got the lab.

1596
01:24:05,704 --> 01:24:07,475
I'm going after him.

1597
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,762
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1598
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:22,704
Work in progress, my ass...

1599
01:24:38,337 --> 01:24:39,370
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

1600
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:40,940
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

1601
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,409
I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1602
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,712
<i>We're running
out of time.</i>

1603
01:24:47,354 --> 01:24:49,623
<i>Warning,
approaching quantum void.</i>

1604
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:16,778
I'm coming to you, honey.

1605
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:05,507
Guys.

1606
01:26:05,509 --> 01:26:08,714
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

1607
01:26:08,716 --> 01:26:09,717
We can't grow
the lab without it.

1608
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:11,053
Get it to us fast.

1609
01:26:11,055 --> 01:26:12,521
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1610
01:26:12,523 --> 01:26:13,725
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1611
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:17,668
What?

1612
01:26:23,078 --> 01:26:25,414
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1613
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:26,750
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1614
01:26:26,752 --> 01:26:27,554
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

1615
01:26:31,095 --> 01:26:31,963
Huh?

1616
01:26:36,104 --> 01:26:36,905
Awesome!

1617
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:05,626
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1618
01:27:05,628 --> 01:27:06,795
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

1619
01:27:06,797 --> 01:27:08,066
I'm on my way.

1620
01:27:08,068 --> 01:27:09,905
Right. I'll get the lab.

1621
01:27:13,579 --> 01:27:14,581
Hi.

1622
01:27:16,117 --> 01:27:17,052
Oh, that's badass!

1623
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,071
Nice.

1624
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:37,193
Doink!

1625
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:44,972
Come here, you little weasel!

1626
01:27:44,974 --> 01:27:46,677
No, you don't!

1627
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:51,885
I guess maybe you do.

1628
01:27:51,887 --> 01:27:53,990
Come on!

1629
01:28:05,347 --> 01:28:08,754
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1630
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:15,835
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1631
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:18,304
Would you just one time,

1632
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:19,675
please work!

1633
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:22,147
Yes!

1634
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:23,084
All right, I need help.

1635
01:28:24,654 --> 01:28:25,322
Yes!

1636
01:28:26,658 --> 01:28:28,761
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1637
01:28:29,396 --> 01:28:30,763
Somebody!

1638
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:32,100
Hey! Come on, man!

1639
01:28:33,304 --> 01:28:35,005
Not cool!

1640
01:28:35,007 --> 01:28:36,175
Murderers!

1641
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,850
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1642
01:28:41,052 --> 01:28:44,157
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

1643
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,295
You're a badass!

1644
01:28:45,929 --> 01:28:47,729
Yes!

1645
01:28:49,703 --> 01:28:51,138
No, no, no!

1646
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,308
Ant-onio!

1647
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,947
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

1648
01:28:56,949 --> 01:28:58,986
<i>dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

1649
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:01,023
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

1650
01:29:01,025 --> 01:29:02,492
Listen, Uzman...

1651
01:29:02,494 --> 01:29:04,964
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

1652
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,436
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

1653
01:29:06,438 --> 01:29:07,571
In three hours.

1654
01:29:07,573 --> 01:29:08,673
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

1655
01:29:08,675 --> 01:29:10,878
<i>but it looks like
we got some company.</i>

1656
01:29:14,019 --> 01:29:14,986
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

1657
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:17,157
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

1658
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,897
What the...?

1659
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,876
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1660
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:30,449
It's okay. It's okay!

1661
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:32,987
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1662
01:29:32,989 --> 01:29:35,259
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

1663
01:29:35,261 --> 01:29:36,995
No, no! No, no!

1664
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:37,996
You're embarrassing
yourself now

1665
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:41,004
Come on. Let go.

1666
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:42,008
Thank you.

1667
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,249
I'll take this now.

1668
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:03,248
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

1669
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:06,822
<i>A message in your head.</i>

1670
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:10,461
<i>I had a dream.</i>

1671
01:30:10,463 --> 01:30:12,500
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

1672
01:30:12,502 --> 01:30:13,869
<i>It's where I hid
every time that we played.</i>

1673
01:30:13,871 --> 01:30:14,938
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

1674
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:32,573
Daddy?

1675
01:30:37,251 --> 01:30:38,351
Daddy?

1676
01:30:41,626 --> 01:30:44,563
Dad?
What's going on?

1677
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:45,333
Why haven't you found Mom?

1678
01:30:48,139 --> 01:30:50,476
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1679
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:55,018
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1680
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,534
It's me.

1681
01:32:06,194 --> 01:32:08,164
I'm so sorry...

1682
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,702
it took so long.

1683
01:32:11,704 --> 01:32:13,140
No.

1684
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:15,713
No.

1685
01:32:16,649 --> 01:32:18,151
You're here now.

1686
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:20,722
Let's go home.

1687
01:32:23,194 --> 01:32:25,430
I thought I was gone.

1688
01:32:25,432 --> 01:32:28,571
But that energy
from your hands...

1689
01:32:28,573 --> 01:32:29,775
how did you do that?

1690
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:35,751
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1691
01:32:35,753 --> 01:32:37,390
This place...

1692
01:32:38,358 --> 01:32:40,394
it changes you.

1693
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:45,604
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

1694
01:32:45,606 --> 01:32:46,608
evolution.

1695
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,683
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

1696
01:32:51,685 --> 01:32:52,687
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

1697
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,322
I should probably tell you

1698
01:32:55,324 --> 01:32:57,229
what we're dealing with
up there.

1699
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:01,736
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1700
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:04,208
Move.
Move.

1701
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:07,248
Move!

1702
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,250
Get out of the way.

1703
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:15,765
Let's go.

1704
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:21,410
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

1705
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:24,251
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

1706
01:33:29,393 --> 01:33:31,197
Get out of the way!

1707
01:33:31,966 --> 01:33:35,238
I got the lab.

1708
01:33:36,873 --> 01:33:38,442
The air feels chunky.

1709
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:39,879
Oh, no. He's too big.

1710
01:33:43,721 --> 01:33:44,854
Scotty!

1711
01:33:44,856 --> 01:33:46,360
Scott!

1712
01:33:46,362 --> 01:33:48,362
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1713
01:33:48,364 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1714
01:33:51,002 --> 01:33:52,505
I just need five minutes.

1715
01:33:53,876 --> 01:33:55,212
Five minutes!

1716
01:34:02,326 --> 01:34:03,759
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

1717
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:06,332
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

1718
01:34:20,895 --> 01:34:22,464
Move!

1719
01:34:22,466 --> 01:34:24,870
Move! Move!

1720
01:34:26,841 --> 01:34:27,907
No, wait!

1721
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:41,367
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

1722
01:34:41,369 --> 01:34:42,536
They did it.

1723
01:34:42,538 --> 01:34:43,973
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

1724
01:34:43,975 --> 01:34:45,612
Let's go see our daughter.

1725
01:35:08,023 --> 01:35:08,891
Scott!

1726
01:35:10,628 --> 01:35:12,129
Scott!

1727
01:35:12,131 --> 01:35:13,969
Scott, come on, wake up!

1728
01:35:28,564 --> 01:35:30,633
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

1729
01:35:32,773 --> 01:35:34,108
Gotcha.

1730
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,618
Scott?

1731
01:35:45,764 --> 01:35:46,866
Hey.

1732
01:35:46,868 --> 01:35:47,669
Hey.

1733
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:52,943
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

1734
01:35:52,945 --> 01:35:54,582
Did you get crushed
by the building?

1735
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:00,058
Where's the remote, Luis?

1736
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,529
It's probably in there.

1737
01:36:02,565 --> 01:36:04,099
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1738
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:05,604
I guess
this is where we say...

1739
01:36:06,305 --> 01:36:08,608
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

1740
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:09,846
No, no, no, no!

1741
01:36:13,019 --> 01:36:14,085
Thanks, guys.

1742
01:36:20,935 --> 01:36:21,736
Ava?

1743
01:36:22,605 --> 01:36:24,307
Ava!

1744
01:36:27,212 --> 01:36:28,583
Ava!

1745
01:36:28,585 --> 01:36:30,084
Almost ready for extraction.

1746
01:36:30,086 --> 01:36:32,723
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1747
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:35,195
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1748
01:36:35,197 --> 01:36:36,930
What if Hank is right?

1749
01:36:36,932 --> 01:36:38,768
What if this process
kills Janet?

1750
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:40,204
What, you're worried
about her?

1751
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:42,075
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1752
01:36:42,077 --> 01:36:43,644
She may be able to help.

1753
01:36:43,646 --> 01:36:46,282
Oh, she will help.
Right now!

1754
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:48,286
And if she dies, she dies!

1755
01:36:48,288 --> 01:36:51,159
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1756
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:52,965
We have to find another way.

1757
01:36:56,104 --> 01:36:58,106
This is the way.

1758
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,686
Janet!

1759
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:33,009
She started
the extraction.

1760
01:37:33,011 --> 01:37:34,814
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1761
01:37:43,966 --> 01:37:44,969
No!

1762
01:38:19,503 --> 01:38:20,405
Hope!

1763
01:38:37,472 --> 01:38:38,842
Are you okay?

1764
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:55,242
Mom?

1765
01:39:03,292 --> 01:39:04,594
Oh, my God.

1766
01:39:09,938 --> 01:39:11,306
We found you.

1767
01:39:15,314 --> 01:39:17,550
I missed you so much.

1768
01:39:17,552 --> 01:39:19,590
I missed you too,
Jellybean.

1769
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:23,696
It's okay.

1770
01:39:23,698 --> 01:39:26,903
I'm here now.
We have time.

1771
01:39:28,975 --> 01:39:30,945
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1772
01:39:31,246 --> 01:39:33,316
I promise.

1773
01:39:33,318 --> 01:39:34,686
No, it's okay!

1774
01:39:34,688 --> 01:39:36,421
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1775
01:39:36,423 --> 01:39:38,159
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

1776
01:39:43,337 --> 01:39:45,305
Scott.

1777
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:46,978
Miss Van Dyne.

1778
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:50,317
It's nice to...

1779
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:51,718
Well, I guess
we've already met.

1780
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,090
Yeah. I guess we have.

1781
01:39:57,131 --> 01:39:58,134
Wait.

1782
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:08,019
Your pain.

1783
01:40:10,091 --> 01:40:11,226
I can feel it.

1784
01:40:13,798 --> 01:40:15,068
It hurts.

1785
01:40:17,405 --> 01:40:19,076
It always hurts.

1786
01:40:22,215 --> 01:40:23,516
I'm sorry.

1787
01:40:26,657 --> 01:40:28,726
I think I can help you.

1788
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:04,765
Did you know
she could do that?

1789
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:09,841
It's okay.

1790
01:41:12,515 --> 01:41:13,683
Guys, the cops are coming!

1791
01:41:14,185 --> 01:41:14,786
Whoa.

1792
01:41:17,259 --> 01:41:20,562
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1793
01:41:20,564 --> 01:41:22,201
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

1794
01:41:23,302 --> 01:41:24,572
What about them?

1795
01:41:27,612 --> 01:41:29,748
Hands in the air!

1796
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,320
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

1797
01:41:32,322 --> 01:41:34,322
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1798
01:41:34,324 --> 01:41:37,696
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1799
01:41:37,698 --> 01:41:39,901
We traffic
in stolen technology.

1800
01:41:39,903 --> 01:41:41,737
And we have killed many,
many people.

1801
01:41:41,739 --> 01:41:43,540
Uh, he's in charge.

1802
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:44,344
That's true, I am.

1803
01:41:45,381 --> 01:41:46,379
I've also committed

1804
01:41:46,381 --> 01:41:48,751
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1805
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:50,757
Some of them
would shock you.

1806
01:41:53,898 --> 01:41:56,269
It is truth serum.

1807
01:42:00,444 --> 01:42:01,978
We gotta get outta here.

1808
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,582
Fast.

1809
01:42:04,752 --> 01:42:06,921
I have an idea.

1810
01:42:06,923 --> 01:42:08,023
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

1811
01:42:08,025 --> 01:42:09,526
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

1812
01:42:09,528 --> 01:42:10,794
<i>All units move in.</i>

1813
01:42:10,796 --> 01:42:12,398
Go, go!

1814
01:42:15,408 --> 01:42:16,643
There he is!

1815
01:42:21,854 --> 01:42:23,687
It's over, Scotty!

1816
01:42:23,689 --> 01:42:26,660
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

1817
01:42:26,662 --> 01:42:28,665
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1818
01:42:28,667 --> 01:42:29,602
There's nowhere to hide.

1819
01:42:31,773 --> 01:42:34,712
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1820
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:38,887
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1821
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:46,568
Magic.

1822
01:42:48,773 --> 01:42:49,941
Damn it!

1823
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:51,680
Get to Lang's, now!

1824
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:00,361
Well done, honey.

1825
01:43:00,363 --> 01:43:01,698
Let's go!

1826
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,014
Leave me here.

1827
01:43:11,016 --> 01:43:12,451
We can make it.

1828
01:43:12,453 --> 01:43:13,355
You said it yourself.

1829
01:43:14,759 --> 01:43:16,928
I've hurt people.

1830
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:18,766
But you haven't.

1831
01:43:18,768 --> 01:43:20,634
Go. Please!

1832
01:43:20,636 --> 01:43:21,738
We can make it, Ava.

1833
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:23,674
Bill...

1834
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:25,880
I'm not leaving you.

1835
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:11,702
Oh, hey, guys.

1836
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:13,442
Are my two years up already?

1837
01:44:20,256 --> 01:44:22,291
What's it like out there?

1838
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:25,696
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

1839
01:44:25,698 --> 01:44:27,968
Are food trucks
still a thing?

1840
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,906
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1841
01:44:29,908 --> 01:44:32,946
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

1842
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:33,982
Where?

1843
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:36,184
Huh?

1844
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:37,823
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1845
01:44:38,824 --> 01:44:42,299
Like, in general...

1846
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:44,168
The next time
you do something bad,

1847
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,803
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

1848
01:44:45,805 --> 01:44:48,075
You'll be watching...

1849
01:44:48,077 --> 01:44:50,113
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1850
01:44:51,117 --> 01:44:53,186
Why would I do that?

1851
01:44:53,188 --> 01:44:55,723
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1852
01:44:55,725 --> 01:44:57,193
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1853
01:44:57,195 --> 01:44:59,298
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1854
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,834
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

1855
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:02,003
Of course,
that would be strange.

1856
01:45:02,005 --> 01:45:03,807
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

1857
01:45:05,011 --> 01:45:06,647
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1858
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:08,750
I mean, because I'm free...

1859
01:45:08,752 --> 01:45:10,121
Yeah. Come on.

1860
01:45:19,675 --> 01:45:20,406
You ready?

1861
01:45:20,408 --> 01:45:21,610
Yeah!

1862
01:45:23,716 --> 01:45:25,118
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1863
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:28,656
Oh!

1864
01:45:28,658 --> 01:45:30,827
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1865
01:45:31,698 --> 01:45:32,299
X-Con Security.

1866
01:45:34,002 --> 01:45:35,005
Mr. Karapetyan?

1867
01:45:35,838 --> 01:45:37,976
Yeah, you saw that?

1868
01:45:37,978 --> 01:45:41,950
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1869
01:45:41,952 --> 01:45:43,288
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1870
01:45:44,322 --> 01:45:45,924
Yeah!

1871
01:45:45,926 --> 01:45:48,163
That's how you close a deal!

1872
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,223
This is awesome.

1873
01:46:18,992 --> 01:46:20,527
So, Cassie...

1874
01:46:20,529 --> 01:46:22,530
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1875
01:46:22,532 --> 01:46:24,534
I wanna help people...

1876
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:25,438
like my dad.

1877
01:46:26,439 --> 01:46:27,442
Really?

1878
01:46:29,011 --> 01:46:30,847
I wanted to be his partner.

1879
01:46:30,849 --> 01:46:32,217
But he said he wants you.

1880
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:34,422
Is that so?

1881
01:46:39,298 --> 01:46:40,467
Daddy!

1882
01:46:41,503 --> 01:46:43,406
Whoa! Hold on.

1883
01:46:43,408 --> 01:46:45,477
Move, get outta here!

1884
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:47,479
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1885
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:49,552
Ow.

1886
01:46:49,554 --> 01:46:51,821
Oh, gross!

1887
01:46:51,823 --> 01:46:54,259
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1888
01:46:54,261 --> 01:46:58,001
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

1889
01:49:05,355 --> 01:49:07,491
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1890
01:49:07,493 --> 01:49:10,432
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1891
01:49:10,733 --> 01:49:12,735
Now, I got this.

1892
01:49:12,737 --> 01:49:15,842
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1893
01:49:15,844 --> 01:49:18,615
This is... smaller.

1894
01:49:19,851 --> 01:49:23,290
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1895
01:49:23,292 --> 01:49:25,327
Ah, I think it has flair.

1896
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:28,403
All right. Control's online.

1897
01:49:32,176 --> 01:49:34,513
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1898
01:49:34,515 --> 01:49:36,182
It should automatically
start absorbing

1899
01:49:36,184 --> 01:49:37,919
quantum healing particles.

1900
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:40,692
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1901
01:49:40,694 --> 01:49:42,394
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1902
01:49:42,396 --> 01:49:44,298
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

1903
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:45,469
We won't be able to save you.

1904
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:49,643
Okay.

1905
01:49:50,947 --> 01:49:52,315
Going subatomic in five...

1906
01:49:53,586 --> 01:49:54,387
four...

1907
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:56,125
three...

1908
01:49:56,591 --> 01:49:57,692
two...

1909
01:49:57,694 --> 01:49:58,496
one.

1910
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:04,774
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

1911
01:50:09,985 --> 01:50:12,353
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

1912
01:50:12,355 --> 01:50:14,893
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

1913
01:50:14,895 --> 01:50:16,294
Scott, we read you.

1914
01:50:16,296 --> 01:50:17,498
I just wanna
make sure.

1915
01:50:23,244 --> 01:50:24,646
Okay.

1916
01:50:24,648 --> 01:50:27,352
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1917
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,519
<i>Great.</i>

1918
01:50:28,521 --> 01:50:30,258
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

1919
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,861
<i>five, four, three...</i>

1920
01:50:36,404 --> 01:50:37,573
Hello?

1921
01:50:38,908 --> 01:50:41,045
Ha, ha. Very funny.

1922
01:50:41,047 --> 01:50:42,548
Hank, quit screwing around.

1923
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,721
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

1924
01:50:45,756 --> 01:50:46,557
<i>Hank?</i>

1925
01:50:48,296 --> 01:50:49,431
<i>Hope?</i>

1926
01:50:49,864 --> 01:50:50,865
<i>Janet.</i>

1927
01:50:52,069 --> 01:50:53,271
<i>Guys.</i>

1928
01:50:54,506 --> 01:50:56,677
<i>Guys.</i>

1929
01:50:56,679 --> 01:50:58,045
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

1930
01:50:58,047 --> 01:50:59,580
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

1931
01:50:59,582 --> 01:51:00,585
<i>Guys!</i>
