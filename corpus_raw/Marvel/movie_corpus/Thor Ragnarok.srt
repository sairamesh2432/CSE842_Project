Trash.

No, not trash.

579
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,506
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

580
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,958
It doesn't start with a "B."

Booze hag.

I was thinking about "best."

'Cause I always say
you're the best.

participate in it.

And you, my friend,

644
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,897
might just be part
of the new cast.

645
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,110
What do you say to that?

646
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,192
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

I let go. (LAUGHS)

What do you mean,
what am I doing?

660
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,555
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

661
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,935
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

664
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,102
I've made friends
with this man.

He's called the Grandmaster.

- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

667

out here weeks ago.

- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

whispering about?

(YELPS)

Time works real different
around these parts.

00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,037
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,827

You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

God of Thunder.
Tell him.

I've never met this man
in my life.

- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

681
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,642
Is he any kind of a fighter?

682
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,057
(LAUGHS) You take this thing

683
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,137
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,980
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

686
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,485
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

687
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,819
Asgard.

688
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,740
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

689
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,658
their freedom they shall win.

690
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,489
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

691
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,036
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

692
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,786
That's what I call, contender.

693
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,329
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

694
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,002
Ah! Loki!

Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,679
- (PANTING)
- Over here.

698
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,339
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

699
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,058
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

700
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,893
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

701
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,266
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

702
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,305
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

703
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,857
But don't let that
intimidate you.

704
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,312
You don't need to be afraid

705
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,939
unless you're
made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,315
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

707
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,396
joke for you.

708
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,316
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

709
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,235
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

710
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,283
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

711
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,123
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

712
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,083
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

713
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,205
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

714
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,870
So hardly anyone turned up,

715
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,547
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

716
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,169
As punishment, I was forced

717
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,627
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

718
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,132
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

719
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,055
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

720
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,340
I don't know
if you'd be interested

721
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,471
in something like that.

722
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,223
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

723
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,513
How did you...

724
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,357
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

725
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,690
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

726
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,192
This doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,568
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

728
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,191
The only thing
that does make sense

729
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,651
is that nothing makes sense.

730
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,203
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

731
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,487
Doug has.

732
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,655
Doug!

733
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,906
Our luck, Doug's dead.

734
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:25,991
That's right.

735
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,250
Everyone who fights

736
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,417
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

737
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,416
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

738
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,211
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

739
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,292
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

740
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,218
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

741
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,129
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

742
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,718
Yes, I am.

743
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,800
Gonna fight him, win,

744
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,180
and get the hell out
of this place.

745
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,678
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

746
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,730
See you later, new Doug.

747
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,275
Does no one remember me?

748
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,321
Has no one been taught
our history?

749
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,460
Look at these lies.

750
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,629
Goblets and garden parties?

751
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,545

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,586
Odin...

753
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,337
proud to have it...

754
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,881
ashamed of how he got it.

756
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,444
We were unstoppable.

757
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,450
I was his weapon
in the conquest

758
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,998
that built Asgard's empire.

759
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,167
One by one,
the realms became ours.

760
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,508
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

761
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,343
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

762
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,387
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

763
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,179

beneath this very palace.

it would be.

Being told you're one thing

789
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,329
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

790
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,170
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

791

you don't want my help?

Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

It took me time

He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

What I'm telling you is,

798

you could join me

Hammer?

844
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,179
Quite unique.
It was made from this

special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

And when I spun it really,
really fast,

00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,851
it gave me the ability to fly.

No, I didn't ride the hammer.

The hammer rode you
on your back?

851
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,073
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

852
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,742
and it would pull me
off the...

Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

854

off the ground,

855

up into the air,
and I would fly.

with this hammer...

you were all women.

01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,642
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1423
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,764
I just need you to stay calm.

1424
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,853
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1425
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,764
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1426
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:21,894
Yeah. One.

1427
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,770
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1428
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,185
It's a new experience.

1429
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,316
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1430
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,398
than my brain can handle
the information.

1431
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,820
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1432
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,826
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1433
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,198
each had a hand on the wheel.

1434
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,243
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1435
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,869
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1436
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,913
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1437
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,164
No, it's not what matters.

1438
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,415
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1439
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,041
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1440
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,665
Banner may never come back.

1441
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,174
And we're stranded on a planet

1442
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,001
that is designed
to stress me out.

1443
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,211
We're not stranded.

1444
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,637
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1445
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,172
Thank you.

1446
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,508
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1447
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:57,888
What?

1448
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,727
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1449
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,476
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1450
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,474
who also happens
to be my sister.

1451
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,397
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1452
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,693
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1453
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,021
That's a family issue.

1454
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,397
No, she's an evil being.

1455
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,278
I don't care what she is.

1456
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,530
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1457
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,777
- What?
- I just told you.

1458
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,612
If I turn into the Hulk,

1459
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:18,867
I am never gonna
come back again.

1460
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,119
And you don't care.

1461
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,999
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1462
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,501
The Hulk is the fire.

1463
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,458
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1464
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,125
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1465
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,045
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1466
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,042
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1467
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,377
He's all like...

1468
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,965
"Smash, smash, smash."

1469
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,213
I prefer you.

1470
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,131
Thanks.

1471
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,509
But if I'm being honest,

1472
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,969
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1473
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,516
he is very powerful
and useful.

1474
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,643
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1475
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,023
Is he though?

1476
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,310
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1477
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,270
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1478
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,106
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1479
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,154
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1480
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,325
What are you doing with that?

1481
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,489
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1482
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,245
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1483
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,585
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1484
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,545
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1485
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,248
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1486
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,716
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1487
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:12,959
Because you were naked.

1488
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,253
Okay, I'll give you that.

1489
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,387
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1490
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:17,839
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1491
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:18,923
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1492
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,260
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1493
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,804
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1494
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,435
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1495

Hey. Shh. It's okay.

- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1595
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,619
There are one or two ships.

1596
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,703

01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,167

has a great many ships.

01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,254

1601
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,305
the access codes
to his security system.

1602
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,590

1603
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:30,766
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1604
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,051
Heavens, no.

1605
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,761
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1606
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,687
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1607
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,020
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1608
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,735
You're telling us
that you can get us

1609
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,937
access into the garage...

1610
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,646

any alarms?

1611
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,652
Yes, brother. I can.

1612
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:48,572
Okay, can I just... (WHISTLES)
A quick FYI.

1613
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,452
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1614
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,073
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1615
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,414
He did try to kill me.

1616
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,417
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1617
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,169
There was one time
when we were children...

1618
01:26:58,422 --> 01:26:59,879
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1619
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,081
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1620
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,082
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1621
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,754
and he transformed back
into himself

1622
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:05,961
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1623
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,089
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

boosting a ship...

No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1630
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,683
We're going to start
a revolution.

1635

It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.
