1
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,128
On your left.

2
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,138
On your left.

3
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,211
On my left. Got it.

4
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:11,378
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:12,973
- On your left.
- Come on!

6
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:23,373
Need a medic?

7
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,858
I need a new set of lungs.

8
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:31,205
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

9
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:32,403
I guess I got a late start.

10
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:35,009
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

11
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:37,729
You should take another lap.

12
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,971
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

13
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:41,729
What unit you with?

14
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:43,288
58th Pararescue.

15
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,008
But now I'm working down at the VA.

16
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,327
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

17
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,645
I kind of put that together.

18
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,289
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

19
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:55,849
It takes some getting used to.

20
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,414
It's good to meet you, Sam.

21
00:01:57,843 --> 00:01:58,844
It's your bed, right?

22
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,005
What's that?

23
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,608
Your bed, it's too soft.

24
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:04,413
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

25
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,532
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

26
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,847
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,203
Lying on a marshmallow.

28
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:13,043
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

29
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:15,658
How long?

30
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:16,969
Two tours.

31
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,483
You must miss the good old days, huh?

32
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,849
Well, things aren't so bad.

33
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,498
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

34
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:26,858
No polio is good.

35
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:28,169
Internet, so helpful.

36
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,283
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

37
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:35,894
<i>Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.</i>

38
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,529
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

39
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,691
I'll put it on the list.

40
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:51,008
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

41
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:52,574
If that's what you want to call running.

42
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:53,818
That's how it is?

43
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,403
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

44
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:58,884
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

45
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:02,411
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

46
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,213
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:09,728
Hey, fellas.

48
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,898
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

49
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:13,129
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

50
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,564
That's hilarious.

51
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,568
- How you doing?
- Hey.

52
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,378
Can't run everywhere.

53
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,404
No, you can't.

54
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,458
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

55
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,609
<i>the Lemurian Star.</i>

56
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,403
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

57
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,969
93 minutes ago.

58
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,932
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

59
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,243
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

60
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,933
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

61
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:49,613
I'm sure they have a good reason.

62
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,492
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

63
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,526
Relax. It's not that complicated.

64
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,898
How many pirates?

65
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,449
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

66
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:01,725
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

67
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,812
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

68
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,652
Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.

69
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,658
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

70
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:10,978
Hostages?

71
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,893
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

72
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:15,803
They're in the galley.

73
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,483
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

74
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,486
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

75
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,128
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

76
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:24,169
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

77
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,178
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

78
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:27,803
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

79
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:42,578
Secure channel seven.

80
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:43,818
Seven secure.

81
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,368
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

82
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:49,011
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

83
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,778
so, no, not really.

84
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:53,010
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

85
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:56,207
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

86
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,090
That's why I don't ask.

87
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,607
Too shy, or too scared?

88
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,734
Too busy!

89
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:06,773
Was he wearing a parachute?

90
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,010
No.

91
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:09,690
No, he wasn't.

92
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,124
Hey!

93
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:05,004
Don't move.

94
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,204
Thanks.

95
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,445
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

96
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:18,818
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

97
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:19,978
She seems kind of nice.

98
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,778
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

99
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:23,458
I'm multi-tasking.

100
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:25,850
I told Batroc...

101
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:27,443
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

102
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,765
...start sending them bodies now!

103
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,691
I have a bullet for someone...

104
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,008
You want a bullet in your head?

105
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,123
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head?

106
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,686
I don't like waiting.

107
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,964
Coll Durand.

108
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,338
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

109
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,044
Start the engines.

110
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:05,444
Okay.

111
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:07,804
Hey, sailor.

112
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:28,604
Shut up.

113
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,244
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

114
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:40,930
All right, I've waited long enough...

115
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:45,578
Hey!

116
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:46,658
Find Batroc...

117
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:47,684
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

118
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,044
...I start killing them!

119
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,244
I'll find him.

120
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,205
Two minutes.

121
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,970
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

122
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,370
Targets acquired.

123
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,130
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

124
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,363
Natasha, what's your status?

125
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,964
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

126
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,124
Hang on!

127
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,329
Engine room secure.

128
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,044
Time is up.

129
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:18,047
Who dies first...?

130
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:20,484
You!

131
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:21,604
Get that one.

132
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:25,164
On my mark.

133
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,974
<i>Three...</i>

134
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:29,494
<i>Two... One.</i>

135
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,852
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

136
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:43,968
The line just went dead.

137
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,694
I've lost contact with them...

138
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,371
Hostages en route to extraction.

139
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,689
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

140
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,211
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

141
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,730
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

142
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,971
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

143
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,009
Natasha.

144
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,323
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

145
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:07,933
Let's see.

146
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,248
Well, this is awkward.

147
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:39,889
What are you doing?

148
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,338
Backing up the hard drive.

149
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,774
It's a good habit to get into.

150
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,330
Rumlow needed your help.

151
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:45,763
What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,529
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

153
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,974
Whatever I can get my hands on.

154
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:53,488
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

155
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:55,446
No, that's your mission,

156
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,523
and you've done it beautifully.

157
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,207
You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

158
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,768
I think that's overstating things.

159
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:21,889
Okay.

160
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:23,809
That one's on me.

161
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,208
You're damn right.

162
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,178
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

163
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,298
I didn't lie.

164
00:13:58,323 --> 00:13:59,688
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

165
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,647
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

166
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,413
I'm not obliged to do anything.

167
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:05,043
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

168
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,764
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

169
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:11,163
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

170
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,887
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

171
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,292
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

172
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,685
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

173
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,971
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

174
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,324
I can't lead a mission

175
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,252
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

176
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:29,094
It's called compartmentalisation.

177
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,968
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

178
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:33,890
Except you.

179
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,128
You're wrong about me.

180
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,203
I do share.

181
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,973
I'm nice like that.

182
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:46,978
Insight bay.

183
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,123
<i>Captain Rogers does not have</i>

184
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,523
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

185
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:52,163
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

186
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,853
<i>Confirmed.</i>

187
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,286
You know, they used to play music.

188
00:14:58,963 --> 00:14:59,964
Yeah.

189
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:03,684
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

190
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:06,210
Granddad worked in a nice building.

191
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:07,609
Got good tips.

192
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:12,288
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

193
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:13,814
He'd say, "Hi."

194
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,886
People would say, "Hi" back.

195
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:19,138
Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.

196
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,164
He'd say, "Hi."

197
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,732
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

198
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,163
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

199
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:26,964
Did he ever get mugged?

200
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,927
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

201
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,813
What would he do?

202
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:35,164
He'd show them.

203
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:39,205
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

204
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:45,047
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

205
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,290
But he didn't trust them very much.

206
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,812
Yeah, I know.

207
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,324
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

208
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,084
This is Project Insight.

209
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:37,445
Three next-generation helicarriers

210
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:40,334
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

211
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:42,292
<i>Launched from the Lemurian Star.</i>

212
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:45,493
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

213
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:50,570
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

214
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,098
Stark?

215
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:53,418
He had a few suggestions

216
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,764
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

217
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,089
These new long-range precision guns

218
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:01,689
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

219
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:06,093
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

220
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:09,373
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.

221
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,618
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

222
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,088
We can't afford to wait that long.

223
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,768
Who's "we"?

224
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:17,204
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

225
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,690
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

226
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,770
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

227
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:26,447
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

228
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,091
You know, I read those SSR files.

229
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,964
"Greatest Generation"?

230
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:34,373
You guys did some nasty stuff.

231
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:36,088
Yeah, we compromised.

232
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,523
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

233
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,210
But we did it
so that people could be free.

234
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:43,610
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

235
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,165
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

236
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:51,334
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that Programme, Cap.

237
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,166
Don't hold your breath.

238
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,811
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

239
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:18,490
<i>Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.</i>

240
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,651
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

241
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,607
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

242
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:39,851
<i>The story of Captain America
is one of Honour, bravery and sacrifice.</i>

243
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,288
<i>Denied enlistment due to poor health,</i>

244
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,730
<i>Steven Rogers was chosen
for a Programme</i>

245
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:53,052
<i>unique in the annals
of American warfare.</i>

246
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:59,004
<i>One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

247
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:06,684
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

248
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,210
<i>everyone's favourite war hero,
Captain America...</i>

249
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:10,888
<i>Battle tested,</i>

250
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:12,044
<i>Captain America</i>

251
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:15,532
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

252
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:16,764
<i>Their mission:</i>

253
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:20,764
<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

254
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,085
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

255
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:30,365
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable</i>

256
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,452
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

257
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:37,893
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

258
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,614
<i>in service of his country.</i>

259
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,458
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

260
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,965
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

261
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,772
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

262
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:57,609
<i>he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade</i>

263
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,369
<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

264
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,768
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

265
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,333
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

266
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:10,613
<i>Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.</i>

267
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:14,248
<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

268
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,803
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

269
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,291
I have lived a life.

270
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,412
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

271
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,650
What is it?

272
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,891
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

273
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,644
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

274
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:55,938
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

275
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,453
Serve.

276
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:02,685
It's just not the same.

277
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:04,687
You're always so dramatic.

278
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:11,530
Look, you saved the world.

279
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:17,849
We rather mucked it up.

280
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:19,489
You didn't.

281
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:23,764
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

282
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:25,650
Hey.

283
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:32,727
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

284
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:36,085
All we can do is our best.

285
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:40,527
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

286
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:49,004
Peggy.

287
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:55,844
Steve.

288
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,730
Yeah?

289
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,689
You're alive.

290
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:04,448
You came back.

291
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,724
Yeah, Peggy.

292
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:11,484
It's been so long.

293
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,533
So long.

294
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:19,089
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

295
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,411
Not when she owes me a dance.

296
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:28,768
Secure office.

297
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,573
<i>Open Lemurian Star's

302
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:56,532
<i>Override denied. All files sealed.</i>

303
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,168
On whose authority?

304
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,604
<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

305
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:07,289
World Security Council.

306
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,649
<i>Confirmed.</i>

307
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,603
<i>If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs</i>

308
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:17,006
<i>and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

309
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:18,364
This failure is unacceptable.

310
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,167
Considering this attack took place

311
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,127
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

312
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:24,684
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

313
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,812
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

314
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:29,091
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

315
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,252
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

316
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,127
Like how the hell did a French pirate

317
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:37,214
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

318
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,485
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

319
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,125
I can draw a map if it'd help.

320
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:45,127
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

321
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:48,887
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

322
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:52,332
Really? I don't.

323
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:56,334
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

324
00:23:57,443 --> 00:24:00,298
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

325
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:03,008
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

326
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,291
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

327
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:09,009
Mr Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

328
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,178
Excuse me.

329
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,807
More trouble, Mr Secretary?

330
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,607
Depends on your definition.

331
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:29,446
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

332
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:31,725
A nuclear war would do it, too.

333
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,169
You busy in there?

334
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:35,853
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

335
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,165
I'm here to ask a favour.

336
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,806
I want you to call for a vote.

337
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,125
Project Insight has to be delayed.

338
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:48,685
Nick, that's not a favour,

339
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,413
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

340
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,323
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

341
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:55,094
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

342
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,330
But if it's something?

343
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:59,333
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

344
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:02,405
Fine.

345
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,690
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

346
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:08,494
Thank you, sir.

347
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:11,573
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

348
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,404
<i>The thing is,</i>

349
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:17,971
I think it's getting worse.

350
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,530
A cop pulled me over last week.

351
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,009
He thought I was drunk.

352
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:27,645
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

353
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,892
I thought it was an IED.

354
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:35,052
Some stuff you leave there.

355
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:37,411
Other stuff you bring back.

356
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,493
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

357
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:44,887
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

358
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,090
It's up to you.

359
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,803
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

360
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,970
Look who it is, the running man.

361
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:57,289
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

362
00:25:57,483 --> 00:26:00,453
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

363
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,369
Guilt,

364
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:04,043
regret.

365
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:06,173
You lose someone?

366
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:09,204
My wingman, Riley.

367
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,284
Flying a night mission.

368
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:13,810
Standard PJ rescue Op.

369
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,051
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

370
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,850
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

371
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:23,294
Nothing I could do.

372
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,885
It's like I was up there just to watch.

373
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,971
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

374
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:32,764
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

375
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,964
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

376
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:41,444
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

377
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,644
So, hell yeah.

378
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:45,163
Are you thinking about getting out?

379
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:46,804
No.

380
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,004
I don't know.

381
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:54,094
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

382
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:55,803
Ultimate fighting?

383
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:58,844
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

384
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:01,404
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

385
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,450
What makes you happy?

386
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:07,047
I don't know.

00:33:42,643 --> 00:33:43,804
I got to go, though.

434
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:45,809
Okay. Bye.

435
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:48,607
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

436
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,364
Yeah.

437
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,050
Hey, if you want...

438
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,405
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

439
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:58,443
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

440
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,494
Yeah? What's it cost?

441
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,172
A cup of coffee?

442
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,614
Thank you, but

443
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,847
I already have a load in downstairs,

444
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:12,887
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

445
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,087
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

446
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,291
Well, I'll keep my distance.

447
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:19,609
Hopefully, not too far.

448
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,323
And I think you left your stereo on.

449
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,253
Right. Thank you.

450
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:28,444
Yeah.

451
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,007
I don't remember giving you a key.

452
00:35:17,923 --> 00:35:20,005
You really think I'd need one?

453
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,653
My wife kicked me out.

454
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:26,489
I didn't know you were married.

455
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,165
A lot of things you don't know about me.

456
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,846
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

457
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:51,005
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

458
00:35:58,243 --> 00:35:59,654
Who else knows about your wife?

459
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:03,489
Just...

460
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,847

461
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:09,613

That's up to you.

463
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:33,645

465
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:40,804

470
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:50,764
His.

471
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,528
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

472
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:58,724

00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:00,643
<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

474
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,454
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

475
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,138
Is he gonna make it?

476
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:05,608
I don't know.

477
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,688
Tell me about the shooter.

478
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:11,011
He's fast. Strong.

479
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,203
Had a metal arm.

480
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:21,803
Ballistics?

481
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:25,890
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

482
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,369
Soviet-made.

483
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:29,364
Yeah.

484
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,578
He's in V-tach.

485
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,658
Crash cart coming in.

486
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:33,698
Nurse, help me with the drape.

487
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,643
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

488
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,128
I want you to charge him at 100.

489
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,688
Don't do this to me, Nick.

490
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:42,163
Stand back.

491
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,529
Three, two,

492
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,453
one. Clear.

493
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:48,538
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

494
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:49,724
Okay, 200, please.

495
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:50,924
Stand back!

496
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,364
Three, two, one. Clear!

497
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:54,570
Get me epinephrine!

498
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:56,858
Pulse?

499
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:57,884
Negative.

500
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,571
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

501
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:23,938
What's the time?

502
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:25,044
1:03, Doctor.

503
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:29,928
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

504
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:09,007
I need to take him.

505
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,044
Natasha.

506
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:38,930
Natasha!

507
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:41,843
Why was Fury in your apartment?

508
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:45,014
I don't know.

509
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:46,763
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

510
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:48,330
Yeah, give me a second.

511
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:49,444
They want you now.

512
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:52,134
Okay.

513
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:57,365
You're a terrible liar.

516
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,333

517
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:17,808
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

518
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,644
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

519
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:37,530
Captain Rogers.

520
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,043
Neighbour.

521
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,807

522
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:44,244
I'm Alexander Pierce.

523
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:46,294
Sir, it's an Honour.

524
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:47,603
The honour's mine, Captain.

525
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,209
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

526
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:54,003
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

527
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,610
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

528
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,283
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

529
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,727
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

530
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:07,412
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

531
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:08,894
and he comes to me with a plan.

532
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,098
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

533
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:13,888
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

534
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:18,450
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

535
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,811
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

536
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:22,414
They find it empty.

537
00:42:23,683 --> 00:42:25,526
Nick had ignored my direct order,

538
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:29,045
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

539
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,845
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

540
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:33,289
including my daughter.

541
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:35,013
So you gave him a promotion.

542
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:36,768
I've never had any cause to regret it.

543
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,085
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

544
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,244
I don't know.

545
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,814
Did you know it was bugged?

546
00:42:49,723 --> 00:42:52,044
I did, because Nick told me.

547
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:55,003
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

548
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:02,969
I want you to see something.

549
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,363
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

550
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,405
Is that live?

551
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:10,171
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

552
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:12,818
Are you saying he's a suspect?

553
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,493
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

554
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,489
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

555
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:20,249
<i>Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.</i>

556
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:23,925
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

557
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,534
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

558
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:31,006
The last one going to
a holding company

559
00:43:31,163 --> 00:43:33,370
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

560
00:43:33,563 --> 00:43:34,923
Am I supposed to know who that is?

561
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,085
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

562
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:40,214
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

563
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:44,251
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

564
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,211
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

565
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:51,407
The prevailing theory

566
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:55,293
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

567
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:57,850
and sale of classified intelligence.

568
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:02,493
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

569
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,408
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

570
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:11,725
Why do you think we're talking?

571
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:17,934
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

572
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:21,889
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

573
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:27,687
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

574
00:44:28,523 --> 00:44:30,890
to build a really better world

575
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:34,766
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

576
00:44:37,003 --> 00:44:38,448
And that makes enemies.

577
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:43,613
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

578
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:46,568
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

579
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:50,648
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

580
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,569
makes me really, really angry.

581
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,898
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

582
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:02,925
I don't think that's an accident.

583
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,087
And I don't think you do, either.

584
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:09,132
So, I'm gonna ask again.

585
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:11,332
Why was he there?

586
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:16,564
He told me not to trust anyone.

587
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:21,010
I wonder if that included him.

588
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:27,129
I'm sorry.

589
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:28,569
Those were his last words.

590
00:45:30,203 --> 00:45:31,409
Excuse me.

591
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:36,288
Captain,

592
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,487
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

593
00:45:40,523 --> 00:45:42,969
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

594
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:45,734
Anyone.

595
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:50,088
Understood.

596
00:46:07,603 --> 00:46:09,014
Operations Control.

597
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:10,608
<i>Confirmed.</i>

598
00:46:11,963 --> 00:46:14,298
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

599
00:46:14,323 --> 00:46:15,654
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:17,083
<i>- Forensics.
- Confirmed.</i>

601
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:18,444
Cap.

602
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:19,844
Rumlow.

603
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:32,168
Evidence Response found some fibres
on the roof they want us to see.

604
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:33,927
You want me to get the Tac team ready?

605
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:35,723
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

606
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:36,924
Right.

607
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,492
What's the status so far?

608
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,563
<i>- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.</i>

609
00:46:53,883 --> 00:46:55,328
Excuse me.

610
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:05,850
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

611
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:08,011
It's messed up, what happened to him.

612
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,534
Thank you.

613
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,530
Records.

614
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:30,849
Confirmed.

615
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:48,526
Before we get started,

616
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:51,245
does anyone want to get out?

617
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,167
Mobilise S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

618
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:43,808
Whoa, big guy.

619
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,608
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

620
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:00,489
It kind of feels personal.

621
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,485
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

622
00:49:28,203 --> 00:49:30,683
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

623
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,528
You have nowhere to go!

624
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:53,498
Are you kidding me?

625
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,685
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

626
00:50:07,163 --> 00:50:10,246
<i>Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.</i>

627
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:12,885
<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

628
00:50:49,443 --> 00:50:50,933
Eyes here.

629
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,206
Whatever your Op is, bury it.

630
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:54,444
This is Level One.

631
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:56,692
Contact DOT.

632
00:50:56,883 --> 00:50:58,563
All traffic lights in the district go red.

633
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,085
Shut all runways at BWI,

634
00:51:01,443 --> 00:51:03,127
IAD and Reagan.

635
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:06,003
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

636
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,244
Scan all open sources,

637
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:10,168
phones, computers,

638
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:11,769
PDAs. Whatever.

639
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,978
If someone tweets about this guy,

640
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:15,050
I want to know about it.

641
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:17,288
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

642
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,254
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

643
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:22,168
Because he lied to us.

644
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:27,285
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

645
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:29,447
He refused to share it.

646
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:32,611
As difficult as this is to accept,

647
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:36,971
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

648
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:05,610
- Where is it?
- Safe.

649
00:52:05,763 --> 00:52:07,367
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

650
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:08,843
Why would I tell you?

651
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,091
Fury gave it to you. Why?

652
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:12,694
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

653
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:13,884
Stop lying.

654
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,723
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

655
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,963
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

656
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,927
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

657
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:24,369
I'm not gonna ask you again.

658
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,449
I know who killed Fury.

659
00:52:31,403 --> 00:52:33,883
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

660
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,927
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

661
00:52:37,123 --> 00:52:39,125
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

662
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,212
in the last 50 years.

663
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,208
So he's a ghost story.

664
00:52:43,563 --> 00:52:46,646
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

665
00:52:46,843 --> 00:52:49,130
Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.

666
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:51,610
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

667
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:53,089
I pulled us out.

668
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:55,172
But the Winter Soldier was there.

669
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,210
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

670
00:52:58,563 --> 00:52:59,564
straight through me.

671
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:01,484
Soviet slug.

672
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:04,689
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

673
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:08,092
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

674
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:13,329
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

675
00:53:14,683 --> 00:53:16,731
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

676
00:53:21,603 --> 00:53:23,492
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

677
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:25,851
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

678
00:53:26,323 --> 00:53:27,818
To any reasonable person,

679
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:30,449
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

680
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:31,928
You know what makes him a traitor?

681
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,450
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

682
00:53:34,603 --> 00:53:36,924
Nick Fury used your friendship

683
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:40,132
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

684
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:42,644
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

685
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:45,853
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

686
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:48,364
Are you calling for my resignation?

687
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:50,003
I've got a pen and paper right here.

688
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:52,689
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

689
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:55,453
But you do want to have a discussion?

690
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:57,526
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

691
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:03,006
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

692
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,651
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

693
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:17,051
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

694
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:20,124
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

695
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:25,778
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

696
00:54:25,803 --> 00:54:27,738
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

697
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:28,843
How much time will we have?

698
00:54:29,283 --> 00:54:31,490
About nine minutes from

699
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:34,170
now.

700
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:41,133
Fury was right about that ship.

701
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:43,405
Somebody's trying to hide something.

702
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,571
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

703
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:48,170
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

704
00:54:48,363 --> 00:54:50,013
Can you override it?

705
00:54:50,763 --> 00:54:53,044
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

706
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:54,524
Slightly.

707
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:06,603
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

708
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:09,458
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

709
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:10,848
to track hostile malware,

710
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:13,813
so if we can't read the file,

711
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,643
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

712
00:55:16,203 --> 00:55:17,563
Can I help you guys with anything?

713
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:21,564
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

714
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:23,686
Right. We're getting married.

715
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:26,163
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

716
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:29,213
New Jersey.

717
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:35,813
I have the exact same glasses.

718
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:38,373
Wow, you two are practically twins.

719
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:40,054
Yeah, I wish.

720
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:41,564
Specimen.

721
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:44,378
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

722
00:55:44,403 --> 00:55:45,404
Thank you.

723
00:55:47,883 --> 00:55:50,250
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

724
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:52,564
Got it.

725
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:57,858
You know it?

726
00:55:57,883 --> 00:55:59,453
I used to. Let's go.

727
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:02,843
Standard Tac team.

728
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:04,374
Two behind, two across,

729
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:06,167
and two coming straight at us.

730
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,218
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

731
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:11,211
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

732
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:12,643
- What?
- Do it.

733
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:21,924
Negative at the source.

734
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,084
Give me a floor rundown.

735
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:24,843
<i>Negative on three.</i>

736
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:26,323
<i>Negative on two.</i>

737
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:28,764
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

738
00:56:36,803 --> 00:56:37,770
- Kiss me.
- What?

739
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:40,005
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

740
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:41,329
Yes, they do.

741
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:52,373
You still uncomfortable?

742
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:54,808
It's not exactly the word I would use.

743
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,051
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

744
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:08,573
Nazi Germany.

745
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,011
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

746
00:57:15,283 --> 00:57:18,810
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

747
00:57:19,043 --> 00:57:20,458
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

748
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:21,814
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

749
00:57:22,043 --> 00:57:24,523
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

750
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:26,488
- That bad?
- I didn't say that.

751
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,247
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

752
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,498
No, I didn't.

753
00:57:29,523 --> 00:57:31,446
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

754
00:57:31,643 --> 00:57:33,293
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

755
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,724
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

756
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,852
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

757
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:39,978
Nobody special, though?

758
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:43,298
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

759
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:45,698
to find someone with
shared life experience.

760
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:47,738
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

761
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,686
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

762
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,009
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

763
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:53,530
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

764
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:55,844
Neither am I.

765
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:57,843
That's a tough way to live.

766
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,165
It's a good way not to die, though.

767
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:03,488
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

768
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:05,523
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

769
00:58:06,243 --> 00:58:07,324
Yeah.

770
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:11,604
Who do you want me to be?

771
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:13,564
How about a friend?

772
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:21,128
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

773
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:38,294
This is it.

774
00:58:39,523 --> 00:58:41,446
The file came from these coordinates.

775
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:43,929
So did I.

776
00:58:52,123 --> 00:58:53,568
This camp is where I was trained.

777
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:57,764
Change much?

778
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,643
A little.

779
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:03,971
Pick up the pace, ladies!

780
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:05,767
Let's go! Let's go!

781
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:07,843
Double time!

782
00:59:09,123 --> 00:59:11,125
Come on, Rogers, move it!

783
00:59:15,163 --> 00:59:16,494
Come on, fall in!

784
00:59:17,523 --> 00:59:18,604
Rogers!

785
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:20,283
I said fall in!

786
00:59:22,603 --> 00:59:23,764
This is a dead end.

787
00:59:23,923 --> 00:59:26,733
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

788
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:31,007
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

789
00:59:32,963 --> 00:59:33,964
What is it?

790
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:36,138
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

791
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:38,086
within 500 yards of the barracks.

792
00:59:38,883 --> 00:59:40,931
This building is in the wrong place.

793
00:59:56,323 --> 00:59:58,132
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

794
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:00,926
Maybe where it started.

795
01:00:19,003 --> 01:00:20,732
And there's Stark's father.

796
01:00:21,323 --> 01:00:22,688
Howard.

797
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:25,243
Who's the girl?

798
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:46,964
If you're already working
in a secret office,

799
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,178
why do you need to hide the elevator?

800
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:54,609
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

801
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:26,565
Y-E-S spells yes.

802
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,566
Shall we play a game?

803
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:35,564
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

804
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:43,771
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

805
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,487
<i>born 1918.</i>

806
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:52,374
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

807
01:02:52,563 --> 01:02:54,406
<i>born 1984.</i>

808
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:55,968
It's some kind of recording.

809
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:58,484
<i>I am not a recording, Fräulein.</i>

810
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:00,892
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

811
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:04,326
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

812
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:06,447
<i>But I am.</i>

813
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:09,728
You know this thing?

814
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,127
Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

815
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:17,570
He's been dead for years.

816
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:20,050
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

817
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,850
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

818
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:25,654
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

819
01:03:26,163 --> 01:03:30,487
<i>In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

820
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:33,448
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

821
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:37,853
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

822
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:41,849
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

823
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:45,604
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

824
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,050
<i>- How did you get here?
- Invited.</i>

825
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:50,890
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

826
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:54,724
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

827
01:03:54,883 --> 01:03:57,045
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

828
01:03:57,203 --> 01:03:59,092
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

829
01:03:59,283 --> 01:04:00,808
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

830
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:04,894
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

831
01:04:05,323 --> 01:04:06,734
Prove it.

832
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,006
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

833
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:13,885
<i>HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity</i>

834
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,246
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

835
01:04:17,443 --> 01:04:20,128
<i>What we did not realise was
that if you try</i>

836
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,133
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

837
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:25,528
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

838
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:29,411
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

839
01:04:30,563 --> 01:04:33,294
<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

840
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:35,611
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

841
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,045
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

842
01:04:38,243 --> 01:04:42,532
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

843
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,607
<i>For 70 years,</i>

844
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:50,406
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

845
01:04:50,603 --> 01:04:53,288
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

846
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,773
<i>history was changed.</i>

847
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:58,285
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

848
01:04:58,403 --> 01:05:00,804
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

849
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:05,613
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

850
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:09,643
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

851
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:12,005
<i>to gain its security.</i>

852
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:16,046
<i>Once a purification process
is complete,</i>

853
01:05:16,603 --> 01:05:19,971
<i>HYDRA'S new world order will arise.</i>

854
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,806
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

855
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:26,490
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

856
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:28,010
<i>A zero sum.</i>

857
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:33,532
<i>As I was saying...</i>

858
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,410
What's on this drive?

859
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:38,886
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

860
01:05:39,363 --> 01:05:41,889
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

861
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:43,618
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

862
01:05:43,643 --> 01:05:46,169
<i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i>

863
01:05:46,603 --> 01:05:50,653
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

864
01:05:56,483 --> 01:05:57,928
Steve, we got a bogey.

865
01:05:58,363 --> 01:05:59,933
Short range ballistic.

866
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:01,978
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

867
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:03,004
S.H.I.E.L.D.

868
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:06,929
<i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

869
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:08,524
<i>Admit it.</i>

870
01:06:08,683 --> 01:06:10,924
<i>It's better this way.</i>

871
01:06:11,123 --> 01:06:12,534
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

872
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:15,083
<i>out of time.</i>

873
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:40,048
Call in the asset.

874
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:57,683
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.

875
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,012
You need anything before I leave?

876
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:04,091
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

877
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:06,407
Okay. Night-night.

878
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:08,293
Good night.

879
01:08:13,443 --> 01:08:14,808
Want some milk?

880
01:08:24,443 --> 01:08:26,286
The timetable has moved.

881
01:08:28,443 --> 01:08:30,172
Our window is limited.

882
01:08:34,203 --> 01:08:36,331
Two targets, Level Six.

883
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:40,010
They already cost me Zola.

884
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,410
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

885
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:46,491
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...

886
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:48,289
I forgot my

887
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:49,649
phone.

888
01:08:54,683 --> 01:08:57,812
Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

889
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:23,498
Hey, man.

890
01:09:23,523 --> 01:09:27,050
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

891
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:28,893
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

892
01:09:31,843 --> 01:09:33,333
Not everyone.

893
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:52,007
- You okay?
- Yeah.

894
01:10:00,923 --> 01:10:02,413
What's going on?

895
01:10:05,683 --> 01:10:09,085
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

896
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:15,847
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

897
01:10:21,723 --> 01:10:23,805
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

898
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,368
but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

899
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:33,443
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

900
01:10:38,603 --> 01:10:39,684
I owe you.

901
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:42,290
It's okay.

902
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:45,050
If it was the other way around,

903
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,938
and it was down to me to save your life,

904
01:10:47,963 --> 01:10:49,453
now you be honest with me,

905
01:10:51,643 --> 01:10:53,532
would you trust me to do it?

906
01:10:55,683 --> 01:10:56,684
I would now.

907
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:01,487
And I'm always honest.

908
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:03,963
Well, you seem pretty chipper

909
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:06,203
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

910
01:11:06,723 --> 01:11:10,409
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

911
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:12,284
I made breakfast.

912
01:11:12,923 --> 01:11:15,847
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

913
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:18,808
So, the question is,

914
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:21,323
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

915
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,084
Pierce.

916
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,014
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

917
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:28,324
But he's not working alone.

918
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:30,844
<i>Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.</i>

919
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:33,493
So was Jasper Sitwell.

920
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:39,484
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

921
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:42,607
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

922
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:45,332
The answer is, you don't.

923
01:11:46,283 --> 01:11:48,012
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

924
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,253
Is this Bakhmala?

925
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,043
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

926
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,014
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

927
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:01,891
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

928
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,603
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

929
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:05,818
What did you use? A stealth chute?

930
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:06,890
No.

931
01:12:07,603 --> 01:12:09,048
These.

932
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:15,403
I thought you said you were a pilot.

933
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:16,894
I never said pilot.

934
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:22,647
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

935
01:12:23,243 --> 01:12:24,688
You got out for a good reason.

936
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,408
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

937
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:28,203
There's no better reason to get back in.

938
01:12:31,883 --> 01:12:33,567
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

939
01:12:33,763 --> 01:12:34,963
The last one is at Fort Meade.

940
01:12:35,923 --> 01:12:38,449
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

941
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:42,609
Shouldn't be a problem.

942
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,927
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

943
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:48,933
because I got
some constituency problem

944
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,006
and I got to press the flesh.

945
01:12:51,203 --> 01:12:53,490
Any constituent in particular,
Mr Senator?

946
01:12:54,043 --> 01:12:55,454
No, not really.

947
01:12:56,403 --> 01:12:58,292
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

948
01:12:58,963 --> 01:13:00,089
Real hot, you know?

949
01:13:00,283 --> 01:13:02,445
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

950
01:13:02,643 --> 01:13:03,683
Who listens at that point?

951
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:05,523
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

952
01:13:05,683 --> 01:13:07,765
Really? Because she's killing my back.

953
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:10,487
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

954
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:11,730
This is a nice pin.

955
01:13:13,003 --> 01:13:15,131
- Thank you.
- Come here.

956
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:17,288
Hail HYDRA.

957
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:22,443
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

958
01:13:23,203 --> 01:13:25,083
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

959
01:13:33,483 --> 01:13:34,644
I need a minute.

960
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,493
Bring the car around.

961
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:41,338
Yes, sir?

962
01:13:41,363 --> 01:13:43,047
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

963
01:13:43,243 --> 01:13:45,849
<i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i>

964
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,010
Who is this?

965
01:13:47,163 --> 01:13:49,848
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

966
01:13:51,963 --> 01:13:53,089
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

967
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:55,964
<i>There you go.</i>

968
01:13:58,803 --> 01:14:00,328
What do you want?

969
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,403
<i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i>

970
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:05,049
There's a grey car two spaces down.

971
01:14:05,243 --> 01:14:07,086
You and I are gonna take a ride.

972
01:14:07,283 --> 01:14:09,012
And why would I do that?

973
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,769
Because that tie looks really expensive,

974
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:14,171
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

975
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:25,003
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

976
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:27,138
Never heard of it.

977
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,258
<i>What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?</i>

978
01:14:28,283 --> 01:14:30,012
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

979
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:38,443
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

980
01:14:39,523 --> 01:14:41,203
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

981
01:14:42,203 --> 01:14:43,204
You're right.

982
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,130
It's not.

983
01:14:45,643 --> 01:14:46,644
It's hers.

984
01:14:50,563 --> 01:14:53,169
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

985
01:14:53,683 --> 01:14:55,578
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

986
01:14:55,603 --> 01:14:56,858
Yeah, she's cute.

987
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,373
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

988
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:12,325
Zola's algorithm is a program

989
01:15:14,003 --> 01:15:15,084
for choosing

990
01:15:15,323 --> 01:15:16,848
- insight's targets.
- What targets?

991
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:18,324
You!

992
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:21,690
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,

993
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:24,329
a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City,

994
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:26,603
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

995
01:15:26,883 --> 01:15:28,487
to HYDRA.

996
01:15:28,683 --> 01:15:30,412
Now, or in the future.

997
01:15:30,723 --> 01:15:32,487
In the future? How could it know?

998
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:37,130
How could it not?

999
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,611
The 21st century is a digital book.

1000
01:15:43,923 --> 01:15:45,766
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1001
01:15:48,683 --> 01:15:49,809
Your bank records,

1002
01:15:50,243 --> 01:15:51,654
medical histories, voting patterns,

1003
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:54,289
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1004
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:59,171
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1005
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:01,283
to predict their future.

1006
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:02,650
And what then?

1007
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,847
My God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1008
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,488
What then?

1009
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:15,166
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1010
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:19,246
A few million at a time.

1011
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:27,964
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1012
01:16:28,123 --> 01:16:29,883
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1013
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,289
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1014
01:16:31,483 --> 01:16:32,530
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1015
01:16:32,723 --> 01:16:34,646
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1016
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:36,283
and access the helicarriers directly.

1017
01:16:36,443 --> 01:16:37,490
What? Are you crazy?

1018
01:16:38,363 --> 01:16:40,123
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1019
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:24,969
Shit!

1020
01:17:36,363 --> 01:17:37,728
Hang on!

1021
01:19:18,123 --> 01:19:21,093
I have her. Find him.

1022
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,364
Go! I got this!

1023
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:09,087
<i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i>

1024
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:11,723
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

1025
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:18,614
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

1026
01:21:18,763 --> 01:21:19,844
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

1027
01:21:45,283 --> 01:21:46,284
Get out of the way!

1028
01:21:46,843 --> 01:21:48,447
Stay out of the way!

1029
01:23:35,523 --> 01:23:36,570
Bucky?

1030
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:38,568
Who the hell is Bucky?

1031
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:08,803
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1032
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:10,413
Get on your knees!

1033
01:24:10,603 --> 01:24:13,218
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1034
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:14,404
Down!

1035
01:24:14,923 --> 01:24:15,924
Don't move.

1036
01:24:22,923 --> 01:24:24,209
Put the gun down.

1037
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:26,326
Not here. Not here!

1038
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:42,890
<i>It was him.</i>

1039
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:49,650
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1040
01:24:50,163 --> 01:24:52,894
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1041
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,289
Zola.

1042
01:24:54,483 --> 01:24:56,087
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1043
01:24:56,323 --> 01:24:58,132
Zola experimented on him.

1044
01:24:58,363 --> 01:25:00,650
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1045
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,698
They must have found him and...

1046
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:05,646
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1047
01:25:09,283 --> 01:25:11,012
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1048
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:16,052
We need to get a doctor here.

1049
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:17,244
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1050
01:25:17,443 --> 01:25:19,043
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1051
01:25:26,323 --> 01:25:29,486
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1052
01:25:32,563 --> 01:25:33,644
Who is this guy?

1053
01:25:44,443 --> 01:25:46,411
Three holes. Start digging.

1054
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:15,486
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1055
01:26:15,683 --> 01:26:16,889
Maybe two.

1056
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:19,045
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1057
01:26:28,963 --> 01:26:31,204
About damn time.

1058
01:26:33,163 --> 01:26:34,767
Lacerated spinal column,

1059
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:36,778
cracked sternum,

1060
01:26:36,803 --> 01:26:38,407
shattered collarbone,

1061
01:26:38,563 --> 01:26:40,247
perforated liver,

1062
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,167
and one hell of a headache.

1063
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:43,768
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1064
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:45,249
Let's not forget that.

1065
01:26:45,443 --> 01:26:47,093
Otherwise, I'm good.

1066
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:49,605
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1067
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:51,851
Tetrodotoxin B.

1068
01:26:52,043 --> 01:26:54,011
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1069
01:26:54,203 --> 01:26:56,012
Banner developed it for stress.

1070
01:26:56,203 --> 01:26:58,809
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1071
01:26:59,003 --> 01:27:00,892
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1072
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:03,370
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1073
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:06,050
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1074
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:07,484
Besides,

1075
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:10,288
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1076
01:27:25,803 --> 01:27:27,134
Sergeant Barnes.

1077
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:30,284
Bucky, no!

1078
01:27:34,003 --> 01:27:37,086
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

1079
01:27:40,963 --> 01:27:44,649
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

1080
01:27:45,043 --> 01:27:46,044
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

1081
01:27:57,443 --> 01:27:58,444
Sir.

1082
01:27:59,163 --> 01:28:00,653
He's unstable.

1083
01:28:01,163 --> 01:28:02,574
Erratic.

1084
01:28:15,843 --> 01:28:16,924
Mission report.

1085
01:28:20,443 --> 01:28:21,774
Mission report now.

1086
01:28:34,563 --> 01:28:35,974
The man on the bridge.

1087
01:28:39,123 --> 01:28:40,363
Who was he?

1088
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:44,050
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1089
01:28:47,123 --> 01:28:48,454
I knew him.

1090
01:28:57,043 --> 01:28:59,728
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1091
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,414
You shaped the century.

1092
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:06,563
And I need you to do it one more time.

1093
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:11,529
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1094
01:29:11,723 --> 01:29:14,408
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1095
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:18,732
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1096
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:23,247
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1097
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:27,887
But I knew him.

1098
01:29:34,403 --> 01:29:35,928
Prep him.

1099
01:29:36,123 --> 01:29:38,729
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1100
01:29:38,923 --> 01:29:40,925
Then wipe him and start over.

1101
01:30:22,643 --> 01:30:26,204
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1102
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:30,206
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1103
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:32,765
it was a responsibility.

1104
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:37,006
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1105
01:30:37,763 --> 01:30:39,003
We have to stop the launch.

1106
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:42,728
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

1107
01:30:45,243 --> 01:30:46,324
What's that?

1108
01:30:46,683 --> 01:30:49,418
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1109
01:30:49,443 --> 01:30:52,811
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponised.

1110
01:30:53,483 --> 01:30:55,167
We need to breach those carriers

1111
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:57,978
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1112
01:30:58,003 --> 01:30:59,004
One or two won't cut it.

1113
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:01,729
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1114
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:05,245
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1115
01:31:05,483 --> 01:31:07,247
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1116
01:31:07,483 --> 01:31:10,646
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1117
01:31:10,963 --> 01:31:13,045
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1118
01:31:13,283 --> 01:31:16,366
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1119
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:17,723
We're not salvaging anything.

1120
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:19,003
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1121
01:31:19,243 --> 01:31:20,338
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1122
01:31:20,363 --> 01:31:21,649
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1123
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,050
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1124
01:31:24,163 --> 01:31:26,283
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1125
01:31:26,483 --> 01:31:28,212
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1126
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,526
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1127
01:31:31,883 --> 01:31:33,567
How many paid the price
before you did?

1128
01:31:36,603 --> 01:31:38,367
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1129
01:31:38,563 --> 01:31:40,443
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1130
01:31:40,683 --> 01:31:43,368
Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

1131
01:31:43,603 --> 01:31:46,368
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1132
01:31:46,603 --> 01:31:47,889
it all goes.

1133
01:31:48,403 --> 01:31:49,609
He's right.

1134
01:31:55,403 --> 01:31:56,450
Don't look at me.

1135
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,532
I do what he does, just slower.

1136
01:32:02,243 --> 01:32:03,893
Well...

1137
01:32:10,163 --> 01:32:12,564
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1138
01:32:24,203 --> 01:32:25,738
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

1139
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:28,965
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

1140
01:32:29,163 --> 01:32:32,770
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1141
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:35,294
How was it?

1142
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:37,253
It was okay.

1143
01:32:37,683 --> 01:32:39,606
She's next to Dad.

1144
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:42,369
I was gonna ask...

1145
01:32:42,763 --> 01:32:44,523
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1146
01:32:45,403 --> 01:32:47,043
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1147
01:32:47,123 --> 01:32:48,613
like when we were kids.

1148
01:32:49,283 --> 01:32:51,763
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1149
01:32:52,203 --> 01:32:53,887
maybe take out the trash.

1150
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:00,334
Come on.

1151
01:33:03,363 --> 01:33:06,810
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1152
01:33:07,603 --> 01:33:11,369
The thing is, you don't have to.

1153
01:33:14,723 --> 01:33:16,363
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1154
01:33:19,643 --> 01:33:21,018
He's gonna be there, you know.

1155
01:33:21,043 --> 01:33:22,090
I know.

1156
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:26,331
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1157
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:29,170
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1158
01:33:29,363 --> 01:33:30,808
He's the kind you stop.

1159
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:35,087
I don't know if I can do that.

1160
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:37,371
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1161
01:33:37,563 --> 01:33:39,053
He doesn't know you.

1162
01:33:39,763 --> 01:33:40,810
He will.

1163
01:33:43,563 --> 01:33:44,849
Gear up. It's time.

1164
01:33:47,483 --> 01:33:48,609
You gonna wear that?

1165
01:33:48,843 --> 01:33:52,211
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1166
01:34:00,123 --> 01:34:01,568
Man.

1167
01:34:02,363 --> 01:34:04,445
I am so fired.

1168
01:34:29,323 --> 01:34:31,564
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

1169
01:34:33,203 --> 01:34:35,126
We are go on guidance.

1170
01:34:37,043 --> 01:34:39,171
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

1171
01:34:39,923 --> 01:34:41,203
And how was your flight?

1172
01:34:41,323 --> 01:34:42,418
Lovely.

1173
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,923
The ride from the airport, less so.

1174
01:34:45,043 --> 01:34:47,569
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1175
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,646
Including Captain America.

1176
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:55,654
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1177
01:34:55,843 --> 01:34:58,733
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1178
01:35:02,683 --> 01:35:03,889
I've been parking there for two months.

1179
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,723
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1180
01:35:05,883 --> 01:35:07,178
I think Afghanistan.

1181
01:35:07,203 --> 01:35:09,205
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1182
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:10,778
Well, he could've said something.

1183
01:35:12,363 --> 01:35:13,694
Must be the dish.

1184
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:17,087
I'll check it out.

1185
01:35:17,923 --> 01:35:20,927
<i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i>

1186
01:35:24,603 --> 01:35:25,618
Excuse us.

1187
01:35:25,643 --> 01:35:28,089
<i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i>

1188
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:31,925
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1189
01:35:34,203 --> 01:35:35,170
Finally, we're here.

1190
01:35:35,883 --> 01:35:37,806
And the world should be grateful.

1191
01:35:38,763 --> 01:35:40,492
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

1192
01:35:40,683 --> 01:35:42,447
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

1193
01:35:44,243 --> 01:35:46,450
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

1194
01:35:47,483 --> 01:35:49,770
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

1195
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:53,333
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1196
01:35:56,483 --> 01:35:58,645
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1197
01:35:58,843 --> 01:36:00,572
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1198
01:36:01,683 --> 01:36:03,367
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

1199
01:36:07,483 --> 01:36:09,804
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

1200
01:36:10,003 --> 01:36:11,083
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

1201
01:36:12,363 --> 01:36:13,763
but I know they're in the building.

1202
01:36:15,163 --> 01:36:17,052
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

1203
01:36:18,603 --> 01:36:20,287
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

1204
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:23,165
<i>Absolute control.</i>

1205
01:36:23,643 --> 01:36:25,008
They shot Nick Fury.

1206
01:36:26,123 --> 01:36:27,249
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

1207
01:36:27,803 --> 01:36:30,010
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1208
01:36:30,163 --> 01:36:32,483
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

1209
01:36:35,443 --> 01:36:36,854
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

1210
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:41,969
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

1211
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:47,046
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

1212
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:49,692
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1213
01:36:52,043 --> 01:36:54,853
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1214
01:36:56,523 --> 01:36:58,287
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1215
01:37:03,043 --> 01:37:06,331
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1216
01:37:06,843 --> 01:37:08,447
You smug son of a bitch.

1217
01:37:12,523 --> 01:37:13,604
Arrest him.

1218
01:37:16,443 --> 01:37:18,093
I guess I've got the floor.

1219
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:27,887
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1220
01:37:32,283 --> 01:37:33,818
Is there a problem?

1221
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:34,844
Um...

1222
01:37:38,803 --> 01:37:39,884
Is there a problem?

1223
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:41,164
I'm sorry, sir.

1224
01:37:49,883 --> 01:37:52,090
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1225
01:37:54,803 --> 01:37:56,089
Captain's orders.

1226
01:37:56,283 --> 01:37:57,569
Move away from your station.

1227
01:37:57,923 --> 01:37:58,970
Like he said...

1228
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,218
Hold it right there.

1229
01:38:00,243 --> 01:38:01,608
Put the gun down!

1230
01:38:01,763 --> 01:38:02,764
Captain's orders.

1231
01:38:05,163 --> 01:38:06,608
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1232
01:38:08,443 --> 01:38:10,047
Depends on where you're standing.

1233
01:38:54,443 --> 01:38:56,003
Close the bay door!

1234
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:57,323
Close the bay door now!

1235
01:38:57,803 --> 01:38:58,770
Close the bay door!

1236
01:39:18,643 --> 01:39:19,849
They're initiating launch.

1237
01:39:40,043 --> 01:39:42,649
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1238
01:39:42,843 --> 01:39:44,443
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1239
01:40:17,683 --> 01:40:18,684
Hey, Cap,

1240
01:40:18,883 --> 01:40:20,938
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1241
01:40:20,963 --> 01:40:21,964
You okay?

1242
01:40:24,123 --> 01:40:25,648
I'm not dead yet.

1243
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:34,367
Let me ask you a question.

1244
01:40:36,883 --> 01:40:40,012
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1245
01:40:41,283 --> 01:40:43,483
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1246
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:46,408
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1247
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:52,165
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1248
01:40:52,403 --> 01:40:53,564
Wouldn't you?

1249
01:40:53,763 --> 01:40:55,413
Wouldn't you all?

1250
01:40:57,283 --> 01:40:58,773
Not if it was your switch.

1251
01:41:23,283 --> 01:41:24,489
I'm sorry.

1252
01:41:30,923 --> 01:41:32,493
Did I step on your moment?

1253
01:41:34,043 --> 01:41:36,330
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1254
01:41:37,283 --> 01:41:38,444
Falcon, status?

1255
01:41:38,683 --> 01:41:39,844
Engaging.

1256
01:42:03,963 --> 01:42:05,249
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1257
01:42:07,643 --> 01:42:08,690
Shit.

1258
01:42:39,203 --> 01:42:40,648
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

1259
01:42:41,163 --> 01:42:42,528
Working on it.

1260
01:42:50,883 --> 01:42:51,978
What are you doing?

1261
01:42:52,003 --> 01:42:53,658
She's disabling security protocols

1262
01:42:53,683 --> 01:42:55,483
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1263
01:42:55,643 --> 01:42:57,323
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1264
01:42:58,563 --> 01:42:59,644
If you do this,

1265
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:01,567
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1266
01:43:04,643 --> 01:43:07,169
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1267
01:43:07,363 --> 01:43:08,888
as you really are?

1268
01:43:09,643 --> 01:43:11,088
Are you?

1269
01:43:27,323 --> 01:43:28,370
Alpha lock.

1270
01:43:30,483 --> 01:43:31,814
Falcon, where are you now?

1271
01:43:31,963 --> 01:43:32,885
I had to take a detour.

1272
01:44:03,803 --> 01:44:04,804
Whoo!

1273
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:07,087
Yeah!

1274
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,130
I'm in.

1275
01:44:17,763 --> 01:44:19,606
Bravo lock.

1276
01:44:21,403 --> 01:44:22,689
Two down, one to go.

1277
01:44:24,963 --> 01:44:26,803
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1278
01:44:27,363 --> 01:44:29,969
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1279
01:45:12,443 --> 01:45:15,128
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1280
01:45:15,323 --> 01:45:16,973
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1281
01:45:17,203 --> 01:45:19,218
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1282
01:45:42,763 --> 01:45:43,889
Did you get my flowers?

1283
01:45:46,603 --> 01:45:48,443
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1284
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:52,086
Because I thought you had me killed.

1285
01:45:52,323 --> 01:45:53,768
You know how the game works.

1286
01:45:54,843 --> 01:45:56,618
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1287
01:45:56,643 --> 01:45:57,929
Because you were the best,

1288
01:45:58,123 --> 01:45:59,683
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1289
01:45:59,883 --> 01:46:02,124
I did what I did to protect people.

1290
01:46:03,043 --> 01:46:05,011
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1291
01:46:05,923 --> 01:46:08,244
Disorder. War.

1292
01:46:09,243 --> 01:46:11,564
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1293
01:46:11,763 --> 01:46:13,925
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1294
01:46:15,483 --> 01:46:16,928
Diplomacy?

1295
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:19,404
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1296
01:46:20,323 --> 01:46:23,247
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1297
01:46:25,003 --> 01:46:27,734
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1298
01:46:28,923 --> 01:46:33,247
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1299
01:46:33,923 --> 01:46:35,573
by sacrificing 20 million.

1300
01:46:37,123 --> 01:46:39,091
It's the next step, Nick.

1301
01:46:39,283 --> 01:46:40,409
If you have the courage to take it.

1302
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,685
No. I have the courage not to.

1303
01:46:47,203 --> 01:46:49,138
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

1304
01:46:50,563 --> 01:46:52,964
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1305
01:46:53,123 --> 01:46:55,091
I know you erased my password.

1306
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:57,206
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1307
01:46:57,763 --> 01:47:00,607
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr Secretary,

1308
01:47:04,603 --> 01:47:07,573
you need to keep both eyes open.

1309
01:47:11,963 --> 01:47:13,488
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

1310
01:47:13,963 --> 01:47:15,806
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

1311
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:17,169
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

1312
01:47:17,523 --> 01:47:20,527
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1313
01:47:26,243 --> 01:47:27,324
Six minutes.

1314
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:29,963
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1315
01:47:30,843 --> 01:47:32,493
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1316
01:47:35,123 --> 01:47:36,329
I just did!

1317
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,006
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1318
01:47:56,203 --> 01:47:57,329
I had a big breakfast.

1319
01:47:59,923 --> 01:48:01,254
Steve!

1320
01:48:31,723 --> 01:48:33,283
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

1321
01:48:33,683 --> 01:48:34,969
Yeah, I'm here.

1322
01:48:35,523 --> 01:48:36,683
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1323
01:48:37,603 --> 01:48:39,253
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.</i>

1324
01:48:39,843 --> 01:48:42,210
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1325
01:48:43,003 --> 01:48:44,892
Don't worry. I got it.

1326
01:48:46,883 --> 01:48:48,578
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

1327
01:48:48,603 --> 01:48:51,573
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

1328
01:48:53,163 --> 01:48:55,243
All S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1329
01:49:00,763 --> 01:49:02,891
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

1330
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:05,604
<i>- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black Widow's up there.</i>

1331
01:49:05,803 --> 01:49:07,134
Headed up.

1332
01:49:09,323 --> 01:49:10,609
<i>- Falcon?
- Yeah.</i>

1333
01:49:10,723 --> 01:49:11,738
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1334
01:49:11,763 --> 01:49:12,764
I'm on it.

1335
01:49:24,363 --> 01:49:25,443
People are gonna die, Buck.

1336
01:49:27,523 --> 01:49:29,013
I can't let that happen.

1337
01:49:37,443 --> 01:49:38,808
Please don't make me do this.

1338
01:50:49,003 --> 01:50:50,050
Done.

1339
01:50:51,043 --> 01:50:52,044
And it's trending.

1340
01:50:59,683 --> 01:51:01,578
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1341
01:51:01,603 --> 01:51:02,729
I'd put that gun down.

1342
01:51:05,403 --> 01:51:07,371
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1343
01:51:41,203 --> 01:51:42,284
Drop it!

1344
01:51:42,923 --> 01:51:43,924
Drop it!

1345
01:52:04,443 --> 01:52:07,686
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1346
01:52:14,403 --> 01:52:16,007
This is gonna hurt.

1347
01:52:17,283 --> 01:52:20,366
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1348
01:52:20,563 --> 01:52:22,804
And order only comes through pain.

1349
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:26,570
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1350
01:52:28,363 --> 01:52:29,778
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1351
01:52:29,803 --> 01:52:31,938
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

1352
01:52:31,963 --> 01:52:34,967
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1353
01:52:38,963 --> 01:52:40,044
One minute.

1354
01:52:59,963 --> 01:53:01,488
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

1355
01:53:03,123 --> 01:53:04,648
Stand by.

1356
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:08,973
Charlie...

1357
01:53:18,243 --> 01:53:20,538
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

1358
01:53:20,563 --> 01:53:21,643
Sat link coming online now.

1359
01:53:24,083 --> 01:53:25,164
Deploy algorithm.

1360
01:53:26,843 --> 01:53:28,483
Algorithm deployed.

1361
01:53:29,243 --> 01:53:30,763
<i>We are go to target.</i>

1362
01:53:49,763 --> 01:53:51,128
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

1363
01:53:51,523 --> 01:53:52,578
All targets assigned.

1364
01:53:52,603 --> 01:53:53,650
Fire when ready.

1365
01:53:56,123 --> 01:53:57,329
Firing in...

1366
01:53:57,483 --> 01:53:58,564
<i>Three,</i>

1367
01:53:58,843 --> 01:53:59,898
two...

1368
01:54:01,043 --> 01:54:02,374
One.

1369
01:54:05,043 --> 01:54:06,090
Charlie lock.

1370
01:54:06,563 --> 01:54:07,564
Where are the targets?

1371
01:54:09,043 --> 01:54:10,044
Where are the targets?

1372
01:54:10,683 --> 01:54:11,889
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1373
01:54:29,323 --> 01:54:30,324
Fire now.

1374
01:54:31,403 --> 01:54:32,643
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1375
01:54:33,403 --> 01:54:34,564
<i>Do it now!</i>

1376
01:55:05,123 --> 01:55:06,124
What a waste.

1377
01:55:06,283 --> 01:55:09,492
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1378
01:55:09,683 --> 01:55:12,766
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1379
01:55:13,243 --> 01:55:14,768
You're going to fly me out of here.

1380
01:55:14,963 --> 01:55:18,126
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1381
01:55:18,323 --> 01:55:19,654
You already did.

1382
01:55:19,803 --> 01:55:21,771
You will again, when it's useful.

1383
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:36,244
Romanoff.

1384
01:55:36,963 --> 01:55:38,044
Natasha.

1385
01:55:40,123 --> 01:55:41,887
Natasha! Come on!

1386
01:55:48,963 --> 01:55:50,488
Those really do sting.

1387
01:56:23,523 --> 01:56:24,934
Hail HYDRA.

1388
01:57:20,403 --> 01:57:21,893
You're out of your depth, kid.

1389
01:57:25,603 --> 01:57:27,093
Son of a bitch!

1390
01:57:39,243 --> 01:57:41,083
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1391
01:57:41,603 --> 01:57:43,163
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

1392
01:57:43,603 --> 01:57:45,446
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1393
01:57:45,643 --> 01:57:47,213
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1394
01:57:47,403 --> 01:57:48,484
Not an option!

1395
01:58:03,283 --> 01:58:05,445
41st floor! 41st!

1396
01:58:05,803 --> 01:58:09,125
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1397
01:58:10,523 --> 01:58:13,003
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1398
01:58:29,483 --> 01:58:30,564
You know me.

1399
01:58:32,323 --> 01:58:33,654
No, I don't!

1400
01:58:43,163 --> 01:58:44,494
Bucky.

1401
01:58:46,003 --> 01:58:47,448
You've known me your whole life.

1402
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:58,928
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1403
01:58:59,123 --> 01:59:00,363
Shut up!

1404
01:59:09,083 --> 01:59:10,528
I'm not gonna fight you.

1405
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:15,854
You're my friend.

1406
01:59:22,883 --> 01:59:24,248
You're my mission.

1407
01:59:26,523 --> 01:59:28,525
You're my mission!

1408
01:59:31,883 --> 01:59:32,884
Then finish it.

1409
01:59:36,363 --> 01:59:38,570
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1410
02:01:50,243 --> 02:01:51,574
On your left.

1411
02:02:42,563 --> 02:02:44,964
<i>Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

1412
02:02:45,163 --> 02:02:46,244
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1413
02:02:46,443 --> 02:02:47,888
<i>I do.</i>

1414
02:02:49,883 --> 02:02:51,643
<i>Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

1415
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:56,206
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1416
02:02:56,403 --> 02:02:58,246
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1417
02:02:58,443 --> 02:02:59,818
made his point fairly eloquently.

1418
02:02:59,843 --> 02:03:00,883
Well, he could explain how

1419
02:03:01,003 --> 02:03:03,609
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1420
02:03:03,763 --> 02:03:07,893
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1421
02:03:08,283 --> 02:03:10,285
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1422
02:03:10,443 --> 02:03:13,333
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1423
02:03:13,523 --> 02:03:14,763
Agent, you should know

1424
02:03:14,923 --> 02:03:16,607
that there are some on this committee

1425
02:03:16,803 --> 02:03:18,931
who feel, given your service record,

1426
02:03:19,123 --> 02:03:20,852
both for this country and against it,

1427
02:03:21,603 --> 02:03:23,367
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1428
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:25,531
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1429
02:03:27,443 --> 02:03:29,047
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1430
02:03:30,043 --> 02:03:33,968
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1431
02:03:35,403 --> 02:03:36,814
Do enlighten us.

1432
02:03:37,083 --> 02:03:38,414
Because you need us.

1433
02:03:39,523 --> 02:03:41,810
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

1434
02:03:42,003 --> 02:03:44,165
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1435
02:03:44,723 --> 02:03:47,488
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

1436
02:03:49,123 --> 02:03:51,091
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1437
02:03:52,123 --> 02:03:53,807
You'll know where to find me.

1438
02:04:29,283 --> 02:04:32,127
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1439
02:04:32,643 --> 02:04:34,168
You get used to it.

1440
02:04:36,883 --> 02:04:39,045
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

1441
02:04:39,283 --> 02:04:41,411
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1442
02:04:42,963 --> 02:04:44,328
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1443
02:04:45,283 --> 02:04:46,523
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1444
02:04:47,683 --> 02:04:49,333
There's something I got to do first.

1445
02:04:50,243 --> 02:04:52,769
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1446
02:04:53,843 --> 02:04:55,527
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1447
02:04:56,643 --> 02:04:58,407
All right, then.

1448
02:05:03,043 --> 02:05:07,253
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1449
02:05:09,043 --> 02:05:10,647
You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

1450
02:05:10,843 --> 02:05:12,493
to saying thank you.

1451
02:05:13,643 --> 02:05:14,724
Not going with him?

1452
02:05:15,203 --> 02:05:16,489
No.

1453
02:05:16,683 --> 02:05:18,685
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1454
02:05:19,523 --> 02:05:21,683
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1455
02:05:21,883 --> 02:05:22,884
That might take a while.

1456
02:05:23,403 --> 02:05:25,007
I'm counting on it.

1457
02:05:27,243 --> 02:05:28,369
That thing you asked for,

1458
02:05:28,723 --> 02:05:31,044
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1459
02:05:34,003 --> 02:05:36,734
Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

1460
02:05:37,163 --> 02:05:38,369
She's not a nurse.

1461
02:05:38,563 --> 02:05:40,406
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1462
02:05:41,323 --> 02:05:43,405
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1463
02:05:44,163 --> 02:05:45,164
She's nice.

1464
02:05:57,643 --> 02:05:59,407
Be careful, Steve.

1465
02:06:00,243 --> 02:06:01,972
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1466
02:06:13,523 --> 02:06:15,287
You're going after him.

1467
02:06:15,683 --> 02:06:16,969
You don't have to come with me.

1468
02:06:17,123 --> 02:06:18,204
I know.

1469
02:06:20,163 --> 02:06:21,324
When do we start?

1470
02:08:20,723 --> 02:08:24,364
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1471
02:08:25,083 --> 02:08:26,414
Everything he knows about.

1472
02:08:27,003 --> 02:08:28,923
<i>Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,</i>

1473
02:08:29,043 --> 02:08:30,852
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1474
02:08:31,043 --> 02:08:32,772
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1475
02:08:33,763 --> 02:08:36,607
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1476
02:08:40,443 --> 02:08:41,933
What we have

1477
02:08:43,963 --> 02:08:46,614
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1478
02:08:49,243 --> 02:08:52,929
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1479
02:08:55,723 --> 02:08:59,569
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1480
02:09:00,723 --> 02:09:04,170
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1481
02:09:04,363 --> 02:09:06,206
and keep them off our scent.

1482
02:09:06,403 --> 02:09:08,644
What about the volunteers?

1483
02:09:08,883 --> 02:09:10,408
The dead will be buried so deep

1484
02:09:10,643 --> 02:09:12,771
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1485
02:09:14,843 --> 02:09:16,083
And the survivors?

1486
02:09:18,203 --> 02:09:19,728
The twins.

1487
02:09:23,283 --> 02:09:26,412
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1488
02:09:28,603 --> 02:09:30,526
It's not a world of spies any more.

1489
02:09:30,723 --> 02:09:32,691
Not even a world of heroes.

1490
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:36,414
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1491
02:09:38,283 --> 02:09:40,570
There's nothing more horrifying

1492
02:09:41,403 --> 02:09:42,529
than a miracle.
