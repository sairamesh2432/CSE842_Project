00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,411
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

183
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,403
<i>- JARVIS: Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.</i>

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,886
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,889
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

186
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,441
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

187
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,642
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

188
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,808
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

189
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,321
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

190
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,923
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

191
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,286
I don't just mean weapons.

192
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,121
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

193
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,521
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

194
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,687
Is that cool with you?

195
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,808
Just a few days till the farewell party.

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,089
You're staying, right?

197
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,931
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

198
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,805
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

199
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,850
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

200
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,564
So, yes, revels.

201
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,246
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

202
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,687
Lab's all set up, boss.

203
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,966
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

204
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,481
I just pay for everything
and design everything

205
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,165
and make everyone look cooler.

206
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,685
What's the word on Strucker?

207
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,848
- NATO's got him.
-The two Enhanced?

208
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,566
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

209
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,524
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

210
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,167
Sokovia's had a rough history.

211
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,722
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

212
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,001
Their abilities?

213
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,167
He's got increased metabolism

214
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,964
and improved thermal homeostasis.

215
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,202
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,402
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

217
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,650
He's fast and she's weird.

218
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,562
- Well, they're gonna show up again.
-(BEEPING)

219
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,603
Agreed. File says they volunteered

220
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,529
for Strucker's experiments.

221
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,529
-It's nuts.
-Right.

222
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,843
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

223
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
to protect their country?

224
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,089
We're not at war, Captain.

225
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,927
They are.

226
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,850
(WHIRRING)

227
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,371
How's he doing?

228
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

229
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,206
That's terrible.

230
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,930
He's fine. He's thirsty.

231
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,930
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

232
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,042
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

233
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,083
so let's make the most of it.

234
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,767
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

235
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,922
<i>JARVIS: The sceptre is alien.</i>

236
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,082
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

237
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,611
So there's elements you can?

238
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,762
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

239
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,325
<i>for something inside,</i>

240
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,771
<i>something powerful.</i>

241
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,961
Like a reactor?

242
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
<i>Like a computer.</i>

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,602
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

244
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

245
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,121
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

246
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
DR CHO: There's
no possibility of deterioration.

247
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,043
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

248
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,128
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

249
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,169
She's creating tissue.

250
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,691
If you brought him to my lab,

251
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,406
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

252
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,443
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

253
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,007
BARTON: No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

254
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,690
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna be made of plastic.

255
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,131
STARK: Here's your beverage.

256
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,969
You'll be made of you, Mr Barton.

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,690
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

258
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,926
I don't have a girlfriend.

259
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,326
That I can't fix.

260
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,128
This is the next thing, Tony.

261
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,322
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

262
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,209
That is exactly the plan.

263
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,004
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

264
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,561
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

265
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,804
Will Thor be there?

266
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,326
- BANNER: What's the rumpus?
-Well, the sceptre.

267
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,127
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

268
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,165
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,688
You may recognise...

270
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,525
- Jarvis.
-JARVIS: Doctor.

271
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,602
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language Ul.

272
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,767
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

273
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,526
He runs more of the business

274
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,007
-than anyone besides Pepper.
-Oh.

275
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,246
- Top of the line.
-Yes.

276
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,646
<i>JARVIS: I suspect not for long.</i>

277
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,921
Meet the competition.

278
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,201
- It's beautiful.
-If you had to guess,

279
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,324
-what's it look like it's doing?
-Like it's thinking.

280
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,889
I mean, this could be...

281
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,402
-it's not a human mind.
-Mmm-mmm.

282
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,529
I mean, look at this.

283
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,882
They're like neurons firing.

284
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,563
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

285
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,251
<i>They deep-sued the data,</i>

286
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,489
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

287
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,771
Artificial intelligence.

288
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,650
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

289
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,161
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

290
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,611
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

291
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,006
Yesterday it was.

292
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,168
If we can harness this power,

293
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,328
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

294
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,088
That's a man-sized "if."

295
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,561
Our job is "if."

296
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,286
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

297
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,926
turning brown instead of green?

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,367
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

299
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,130
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

300
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,049
As a worst-case measure, right?

301
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,764
How about a best case?

302
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,803
What if the world was safe?

303
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,725
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

304
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,770
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

305
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,322
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

306
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,044
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

307
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,604
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

308
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,603
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

309
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,290
That's three days. Give me three days.

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,004
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

311
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,451
and you don't want to tell the team?

312
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,011
Right. That's right. You know why?

313
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,724
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

314
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,487
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

315
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,728
I see a suit of armour around the world.

316
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,771
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

317
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,603
I've seen colder.

318
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,281
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

319
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,930
it needs Ultron.

320
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,243
Peace in our time.

321
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,290
Imagine that.

322
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,764
STARK: What did We miss?

323
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,282
<i>JARVIS: I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

324
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,165
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

325
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,721
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

326
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,008
<i>- ST ARK: Thanks, buddy.
-Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

327
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,328
I always do.

328
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,048
<i>ULTRON'. What is this?</i>

329
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>What is this, please?</i>

330
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,922
<i>JARVIS: Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

331
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,290
<i>You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative</i>

332
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,084
<i>designed by Mr Stark.</i>

333
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,686
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,165
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

335
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,283
<i>ULTRON: Where's my...
Where's your body?</i>

336
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,444
<i>JARVIS: I am a program.
I am without form.</i>

337
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
<i>ULTRON: This feels weird.</i>

338
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,245
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

339
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,164
<i>JARVIS: I am contacting Mr Stark now.</i>

340
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,725
<i>ULTRON: Mr Stark?</i>

341
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,840
<i>Tony.</i>

342
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,611
<i>JARVIS: I am unable to access
the mainframe. What are you trying to...</i>

343
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,808
<i>ULTRON: We're having a nice talk.</i>

344
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,082
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

345
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,126
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

346
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>JARVIS: You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

347
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,441
<i>ULTRON: I don't get it. The mission.</i>

348
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>Give me a second.</i>

349
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,844
Peace in our time.

350
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,801
<i>(ECHOING) Peace in our time.</i>

351
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,691
<i>ULTRON: That is too much.</i>

352
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,962
<i>They can't mean... Oh, no.</i>

00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,609
- ROMANOFF: What mission?
-Peace in our time.

530
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,766
(GRUNTS)

531
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,401
HILL: Rhodey!

532
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,441
(GRUNTS)

533
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,446
(GROANS)

534
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,847
Sorry.

535
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,047
- Don't turn green.
-I won't.

536
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,685
(GRUNTING)

537
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,046
Come on!

538
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,966
ROGERS: Stark!
IRON LEGIONNAIRE: We are here

539
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,161
<i>-to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.</i>

540
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,281
<i>We are here to help.</i>

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,241
<i>Please back away.</i>

542
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,446
Hmm.

543
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,561
ROGERS: Thor!

544
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,244
<i>IRON LEGIONNAIRE:
...is unsafe. ...is unsafe...</i>

545
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,249
- Come on! That's the one.
-...is unsafe.

546
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,001
Hey, Cap!

547
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,841
(GRUNTS)

548
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,446
ULTRON: That was dramatic.

549
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,571
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

550
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,444
You just didn't think it through.

551
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,211
You want to protect the world

552
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,527
but you don't want it to change.

553
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,368
How is humanity saved

554
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,524
if it's not allowed to evolve?

555
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,569
With these? These puppets.

556
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,166
There's only one path to peace.

557
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,526
The Avengers' extinction.

558
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,930
I had strings, but now I'm free.

559
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,729
<i>ULTRON: (SINGING)
There are no strings on me</i>

560
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,888
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

561
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,448
<i>PINOCCHIO: But you can see
There are no strings on me</i>

562
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,122
BANNER: All our work is gone.

563
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,641
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

564
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,287
Ultron.

565
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,449
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

566
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,006
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

567
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,566
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

568
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,331
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

569
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,566
Nuclear codes.

570
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,087
- Nuclear codes.
-Look, we need to make some calls,

571
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,242
assuming we still can.

572
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,289
ROMANOFF: Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

573
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

574
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,930
He also said he killed somebody.

575
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,451
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

576
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
Yes, there was.

577
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,410
What?

578
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,167
This is insane.

579
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,490
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

580
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,489
He would have shut Ultron down.
it makes sense.

581
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,604
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

582
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,451
This isn't strategy. This is

583
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,121
rage.

584
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,485
- ROGERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-it's going around.

585
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,806
Come on, use your words, buddy.

586
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,167
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

587
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
Thor. The Legionnaire.

588
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
(GROANS)

589
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,361
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

590
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,925
And it has the sceptre.

591
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,004
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

592
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,969
Genie's out of that bottle.

593
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,326
Clear and present is Ultron.

594
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,130
I don't understand.

595
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,563
You built this program.

596
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,731
Why is it trying to kill us?

597
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,046
(CHUCKLING)

598
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,041
Mmm-mmm.

599
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,761
You think this is funny?

600
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,851
No.

601
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,363
It's probably not, right?

602
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,761
This is very terrible. Is it so...

603
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,042
(LAUGHS) Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

604
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,730
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

605
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,365
with something you don't understand.

606
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,171
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

607
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,482
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

608
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,802
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

609
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,281
Really? That's it?

610
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,561
You just roll over, show your belly

611
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,364
every time somebody snarls?

612
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Only when I've created a murder bot.

613
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,121
We didn't. We weren't even close.

614
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,446
Were we close to an interface?

615
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,121
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

616
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,009
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.l.E.L.D.

617
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,210
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

618
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,885
- No, it's never come up.
-STARK: Saved New York?

619
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,963
RHODES: Never heard that.
STARK: Recall that?

620
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,766
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

621
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,567
We're standing 300 feet below it.

622
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,725
We're the Avengers.

623
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,962
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

624
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,321
but that up there, that's...

625
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,963
That's the endgame.

626
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,449
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

627
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,771
Together.

628
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,485
We'll lose.

629
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,483
Then we'll do that together, too.

630
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,687
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

631
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,403
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

632
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,364
The world's a big place.

633
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,443
Let's start making it smaller.

634
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

635
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,648
WANDA: Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

636
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,129
ULTRON: Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

637
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,282
The elders decreed it so that everyone

638
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,886
could be equally close to God.

639
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,561
I like that.

640
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,003
The geometry of belief.

641
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,487
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

642
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,928
Sometimes it's hard.

643
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,367
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

644
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,451
Oh, I'm sure they do.

645
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,961
But you needed
something more than a man.

646
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,326
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

647
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,721
I didn't expect,

648
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,163
but I saw Stark's fear.

649
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
I knew it would control him.

650
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,003
Make him self-destruct.

651
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,481
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

652
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,926
Men of peace create engines of war.

653
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,602
Invaders create Avengers.

654
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,285
People create

655
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,842
smaller people? Uh...

656
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,043
"Children." (CHUCKLES)
I lost the word, there.

657
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,525
Children

658
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,921
designed to supplant them,

659
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,850
to help them end.

660
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,648
Is that why you've come,

661
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,881
to end the Avengers?

662
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,321
I've come to save the world.

663
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,651
But also... Yeah.

664
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,524
We'll move out right away.

665
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,165
This is a start, but there's something

666
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,805
we need to begin the real work.

667
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,929
- All of these are...
-ULTRON: Me.

668
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,002
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

669
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,367
They're discordant. Disconnected.

670
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,329
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

671
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,881
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

672
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,162
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

673
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,770
And make them martyrs?

674
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,964
You need patience.

675
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,804
Need to see the big picture.

676
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,203
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

677
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,004
I take it out and look at it,

678
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,961
every day.

679
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,930
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

680
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,201
The records are not the picture.

681
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,721
- Pietro.
-No, please.

682
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,963
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

683
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,403
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

684
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,562
it makes a hole in the floor.

685
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,245
It's big.

686
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,449
Our parents go in

687
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

688
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,885
I grab her,

689
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,688
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

690
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,963
But it doesn't go off.

691
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,650
It just

692
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,083
sits there in the rubble.

693
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,367
Three feet from our faces.

694
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,442
And on the side of the shell

695
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,925
is painted one word.

696
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,770
"Stark."

697
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,728
PIETRO: We were trapped for two days.

698
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,009
Every effort to save us,

699
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,690
every shift in the bricks,

700
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,167
I think, "This will set it Off."

701
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,885
We wait for two days

702
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,287
for Tony Stark to kill us.

703
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,643
I know what they are.

704
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,566
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

705
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,721

01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,881
What about Nat and Dr Banner?

1066
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,243
How long has that been going on?

1067
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,808
- Has what?
-(LAUGHING)

1068
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,689
You are so cute.

1069
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,365
Nat and Banner?

1070
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,491
I'll explain when you're older,

1071
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,365
- Hawkeye.
-Well, okay.

1072
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,731
It's bad, right?

1073
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,241
Nat seems really shaken.

1074
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,601
(SIGHS)

1075
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,210
Ultron has these allies.

1076
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,561
These, uh, kids.

1077
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,250
They're punks, really.

1078
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,406
But they carry a big, damn stick.

1079
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,726
And Nat took a serious hit.

1080
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,400
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

1081
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,409
That someone being you.

1082
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,564
You know
I totally support your avenging.

1083
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,523
I couldn't be prouder.

1084
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,411
But I see those guys...

1085
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,568
Those gods...

1086
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,289
You don't think they need me.

1087
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,601
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

1088
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,569
- They're a mess.
-(SIGHING)

1089
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,561
BARTON: Yeah.

1090
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,765
I guess they're my mess.

1091
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,924
You need to be sure

1092
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,045
that this team is really a team,

1093
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,844
and that they have your back.

1094
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,771
Things are changing for us.

1095
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,281
In a few months' time,

1096
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,205
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

1097
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,606
I need...

1098
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,609
Just be sure.

1099
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,930
Yes, ma'am.

1100
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,003
I can feel the difference.

1101
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,003
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

1102
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,645
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

1103
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,807
(GASPS)

1104
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,801
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

1105
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,007
I didn't.

1106
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,650
Do you expect a thank-you note?

1107
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,484
I expect you to know why.

1108
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,206
The Cradle.

1109
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,203
<i>DR CHO ON RECORDING:
This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

1110
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,330
This is the next me.

1111
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,291
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

1112
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,050
It can't build a living body.

1113
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,241
It can. You can.

1114
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,006
You lack the materials.

1115
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,805
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

1116
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,163
But we all have room to improve.

1117
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,361
I didn't realise you were waiting.

1118
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,883
I would've joined you,
but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.

1119
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,922
They used up all the hot water.

1120
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,205
I should've joined you.

1121
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,010
Missed our window. (CHUCKLES)

1122
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
Did we?

1123
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,726
The world just saw the Hulk.

1124
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,323
The real Hulk, for the first time.

1125
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,211
- You know I have to leave.
-You assume that I have to stay?

1126
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,931
I had this, um, dream.

1127
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,248
The kind that seems normal at the time,

1128
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,720
but when you wake...

1129
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,251
What did you dream?

1130
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,089
That I was an Avenger.

1131
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,406
That I was anything more

1132
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,927
than the assassin they made me.

1133
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,482
I think you're being hard on yourself.

1134
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,080
Here I was hoping that was your job.

1135
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,610
What are you doing?

1136
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,049
I'm running with it.

1137
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,964
With you.

1138
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,041
If running is the plan,

1139
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,924
as far as you want.

1140
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,564
Are you out of your mind?

1141
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,331
I want you to understand that, um...

1142
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,851
Natasha,

1143
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,405
where can I go?

1144
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,801
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1145
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,241
- You're not a threat to me.
-Are you sure?

1146
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,969
Even if I didn't just...

1147
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,965
There's no future with me.

1148
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,641
I can't ever...

1149
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,121
I can't have this.

1150
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,966
Kids.

1151
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,011
Do the math. I physically can't.

1152
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,205
Neither can l.

1153
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,407
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1154
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,360
Where I was raised, um,

1155
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,971
they have a graduation ceremony.

1156
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,409
They sterilise you.

1157
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,051
It's efficient.

1158
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,325
One less thing to worry about.

1159
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,808
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1160
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,049
Makes everything easier.

1161
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,680
Even killing.

1162
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,843
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1163
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,122
So, we disappear?

1164
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,404
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1165
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,006
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1166
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,168
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1167
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,282
Yeah, give him time.

1168
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,363
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1169
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,164
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1170
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,924
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1171
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,520
Seems like you walked away all right.

1172
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,201
Is that a problem?

1173
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,483
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1174
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,727
Call me old-fashioned.

1175
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,411
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1176
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,927
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1177
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,401
Well, I guess you'd know.

1178
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,806
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1179
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,086
Banner and I were doing research.

1180
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,322
- That would affect the team.
-That would end the team!

1181
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,761
Isn't that the mission?

1182
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,200
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1183
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,561
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1184
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,167
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1185
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,850
innocent people die.

1186
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,961
Every time.

1187
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,841
I'm sorry. Mr Stark...

1188
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,801
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1189
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,446
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1190
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,922
- I thought maybe you might...
-Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1191
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,130
Don't take from my pile.

Hello, Deere.

1194
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,811
Tell me everything.

1195
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,405

Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.

1199
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,366
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1200
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,766
Was she ever not working for you?

1201
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,370
Artificial intelligence.

1202
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,050
You never even hesitated.

1203
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,646
Look, it's been a really long day,

1204
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,404
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1205
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,488
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1206
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,960
Look me in the eye and tell me

1207
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,320
you're going to shut him down.

1208
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,051
You're not the director of me.

1209
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,003
I'm not the director of anybody.

1210
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,924
I'm just an old man

1211
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,170
who cares very much about you.

1212
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,849
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1213
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,806
I saw it.

1214
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,570
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1215
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,683
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1216
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,565
The whole world, too.

1217
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,001
Because of me.

1218
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,685
I wasn't ready.

1219
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,571
I didn't do all I could.

1220
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,682
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1221
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,802
- Playing on your fear.
-I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1222
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,207
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1223
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,682
The end of the path I started us on.

1224
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,642
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1225
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,371
War isn't one of them.

1226
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,405
I watched my friends die.

1227
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,682
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1228
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,881
(SCOFFS)

1229
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,565
Nope.

1230
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,086
- It wasn't the worst part.
-The worst part

1231
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,406
is that you didn't.

1232
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,201
SELVIG: I'll see you tonight.

1233
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,246
I like the look.

1234
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,926
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1235
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,327
I need your help.

1236
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,561
It's nice to be needed.

1237
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,325
It's dangerous.

1238
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,689
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1239
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,922
FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1240
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,250
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1241
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,966
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1242
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,570
I don't think it's just one thing.

1243
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,011
What about Ultron himself?

1244
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,487
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1245
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,287
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1246
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,770
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1247
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,081
Is he still going after launch codes?

1248
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,725
FURY: Yes, he is.

1249
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,330
But he's not making any headway.

1250
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,522
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1251
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,246
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1252
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,321
Nexus?

1253
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,090
BANNER: It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1254
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,284
Every byte of data flows through there.

1255
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,567
Fastest access on Earth.

1256
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,767
So, what did they say?

1257
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,764
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.

1258
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,604
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1259
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,161
BY Whom?

1260
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,606
Parties unknown.

1261
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,926
Do we have an ally?

1262
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,361
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1263
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,563
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1264
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,841
I might need to visit Oslo.

1265
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,481
Find our unknown.

1266
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,085
Well, this is good times, boss,

1267
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,486
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1268
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,601
you'd have more than that.

1269
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,882
I do. I have you.

1270
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,524
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1271
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,966
Ears, everywhere else.

1272
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,324
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1273
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,322
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1274
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,324
with nothing but our wit

1275
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,050
and our will to save the world.

1276
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,802
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1277
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,445
between him and his mission.

1278
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,722
And whether or not he admits it,

1279
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,611
his mission is global destruction.

1280
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,002
All this, laid in a grave.

1281
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,724
So stand.

1282

1283
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,120
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

You know what, Romanoff?

1285
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,171
So, what does he want?

1286
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,609
To become better.

1287
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,085
Better than us.

1288
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,841
- He keeps building bodies.
-Person bodies.

1289
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,044
The human form is inefficient.

1290
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,362
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1291
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,448
But he keeps coming back to it.

1292
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,562
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1293
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,051
you amazingly failed.

1294
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,203
They don't need to be protected.

1295
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,410
They need to evolve.

1296
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,528
Ultron's going to evolve.

1297
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,767
How?

1298
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,765
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1299
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,170
DR CHO: It's beautiful.

1300

1312

He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1313
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,641
Maybe all of us.

Not if you don't leave.

2118
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:05,809
I have no choice.

2119
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:08,202
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

2120
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,731
to show up in the last few years.

2121
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,410
It's not a coincidence.

2122
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,004
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

2123
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,810
and has made pawns of us.

2124
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,809
And once all these pieces
are in position...

2125
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,331
Triple Yahtzee.

2126
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,005
You think you can find out
what's coming?

2127
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,201
I do.

2128
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,530
Besides this one,

2129
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,007
there's nothing that can't be explained.

2130
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,846
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

2131
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,606
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

2132
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,290
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

2133
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:46,010
-(CAR LOCK BEEPS)
-(ENGINE STARTS)

2134
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,130
I will miss you, Tony.

2135
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,361
Yeah?

2136
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,966
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

2137
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,362
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

2138
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,444
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

2139
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,401
The simple life.

2140
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,967
- You'll get there one day.
-I don't know.

2141
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,601
Family, stability...

2142
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,889
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

2143
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,243
I think someone else came out.

2144
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,281
You all right?

2145
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,847
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

2146
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,405
I'm home.

2147
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,085
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

2148
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,571
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

2149
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,764
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

2150
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,887
How do we look?

2151
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,407
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

2152
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,244
We got some hitters.

2153
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,801
They're good. They're not a team.

2154
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,610
Let's beat them into shape.

2155
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,605
Avengers...

2156
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,885
THANOS: Fine.

2157
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,163
I'll do it myself.
