2
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:08,452
Mutants, born with extraordinary abilities.

3
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:11,354
And yet still, 
they are children

4
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,662
stumbling in the dark,
searching for guidance.

5
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:20,044
A gift, can often be a curse.

6
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:25,155
Give someone wings and they may
fly too close to the sun

7
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:29,328
Give them the power of prophecy,

8
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:32,301
and they may live 
in fear of the future.

9
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,866
Give them the greatest gifts of all,

10
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,257
powers beyond imagination,

11
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:42,883
and they may think they are
meant to rule the world.

12
00:01:51,937 --> 00:02:01,148
- En Sabah Nur.
- En Sabah Nur.

13
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:16,741
- En Sabah Nur.
- En Sabah Nur.

14
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:29,993
- En Sabah Nur.
- En Sabah Nur.

15
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:28,342
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

16
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,692
Sleep.

17
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:49,897
Let the transference begin.

18
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,899
Watch out!

19
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,637
DEATH TO THE FALSE GOD!

20
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:32,628
The pyramid!
The pyramid is collapsing!

21
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,247
- Run.
- Run, quickly.

22
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:42,500
Protect him!

23
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,647
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered

24
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:32,147
during the Paris Peace Accords
after the Vietnam war in 1973.

25
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:36,667
6 days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

26
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,371
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the president
and the cabinet

27
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,029
on the lawn of the White House.

28
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,976
Their lives were saved by
a young mutant, who stopped him.

29
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:49,586
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most wanted fugitive.

30
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,132
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

31
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,331
But, she has become
the symbol of a new age.

32
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,715
The face of a world
that will never...

33
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,607
- ...be the same again.
- You winking at my girl?

34
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,886
Yes, the world is panicked.

35
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,582
- Your girl.
- ... and there is still some prejudice.

36
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,810
- I guess you do look old enough
- But today,

37
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,334
-  to be her father.
- mutants are found in all walks of life.

38
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,019
Excuse me, gentlemen, is there
something that you would like

39
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,557
to be sharing with
the rest of the class?

40
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,801
Can I please go to the bathroom.

41
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,240
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

42
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,774
Fine, Scott, and afterwards,
why don't you stop by

43
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:20,756
the principal’s office and explain to him
that you're disrupting the class again.

44
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:22,757
I trust you know the way.

45
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,321
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

46
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,283
Oh.
Hang on. Hang on.

47
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,289
Hey.

48
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:37,451
Now, I know most of you were what?
Around 7 years old at that time.

49
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,427
Summers!

50
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,901
I know you're in here.

51
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,357
Are you crying?

52
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,707
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

53
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,198
Summers.
You want to eyeball my girl?

54
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,544
Summers.

55
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,105
Summers.

56
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,157
EAST BERLIN

57
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,009
YES!

58
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,587
Ten fights waged.

59
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:53,262
Ten fights won.

60
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,736
The Winged Warrior.

61
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,500
The Bird of Prey.
The Angel of Death.

62
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,247
ANGEL!

63
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,355
Yes!

64
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:09,781
Let's hear it for the fat man!

65
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,034
Our next challenger...

66
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,966
comes straight...

67
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,922
from the Munich Circus.

68
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,072
FIGHT
11

69
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,567
Ladies and gentlemen,

70
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:23,252
the only one that could 
take on an Angel...

71
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:26,069
is the Devil himself!

72
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,059
I give you...

73
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,098
the amazing...

74
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,423
the fantastic...

75
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:37,337
NIGHTCRAWLER!

76
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,205
Caution.
High voltage.

77
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,760
Sorry, mutants!

78
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,525
Hey.

79
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,918
Did you get lost little mouse?

80
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,040
The fight is over there.

81
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:26,229
Fight!
Or they'll kill us both.

82
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,806
And it's about to get exciting.

83
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,457
Ah, you mean this?
Yes.

84
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,506
Nightcrawler!

85
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:02,574
- Nightcrawler!
- Nightcrawler!

86
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,615
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

87
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:33,992
Come with me.

88
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:36,937
Hold it!

89
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,280
They went that way!

90
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,856
You can transform.

91
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,344
- You're her, the hero.
- I'm nobody.

92
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm not a hero.
Let's get out of here.

93
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:06,297
PRUSZKOW, POLAND

94
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,427
Have a good night, Henryk

95
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,505
You too, Milosz.

96
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:56,840
Hi, my love.

97
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,448
Hi.

98
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,450
Good day?

99
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:05,008
Better now.

100
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,501
- Where's Nina?
- At the back.

101
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,468
With her friends.

102
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,157
Don't worry.

103
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,806
There is enough for everyone.

104
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:28,628
Close your eyes now.

105
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:33,199
Go to sleep

106
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:37,470
and have a sweet dream.

107
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,535
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

108
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:44,130
I learned it from my parents.

109
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,030
And they learned it from their parents.

110
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:49,841
And them from theirs.

111
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:55,100
And one day,
you will sing it to you children too.

112
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:59,852
What happened to them, your parents?

113
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:07,091
They were taken from me,
when I was a little boy.

114
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:13,975
But, they are still here, inside.

115
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,916
And here...
with you.

116
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:23,206
Is someone going to take you away?

117
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,206
Never.

118
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,518
I guess we're more
alike than we thought.

119
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,425
He won't listen to us.

120
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,552
- He just... He's been...
- Scott.

121
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,279
Let me try.

122
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:08,063
XAVIER'S SCHOOL
FOR
GIFTED YOUNGSTERS

123
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:11,628
Smells pretty old in here.
Is this a school or museum.

124
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:15,728
One more, and last one.

125
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:19,304
Oh.

126
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,690
Watch where you're going.

127
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,185
I can't...

128
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:34,762
- What? Who are you talking to?
- Me.

129
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,193
I just heard you in my head.

130
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:41,105
- I'm telepathic, I read minds.
- Well, stay out of mine.

131
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,195
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

132
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,986
Don't worry, Scott,
there's not much to see.

133
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,514
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

134
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,542
No, you didn't.

135
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,050
Alex Summers?

136
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,889
Hank McCoy!

137
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:58,782
Whoa.
What happen to the big blue... furry you?

138
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,393
I, keep it under control now.

139
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,090
- This is my brother, Scott.
- Hey, Scott.

140
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,764
I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

141
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,257
Where's the Professor?

142
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:16,539
... to break forth bloodily, then the past
must be obliterated and a new start made.

143
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:20,093
Let us now start fresh
without remembrance,

144
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:24,546
rather than live forward and
backward at the same time.

145
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,720
Now, what are the aggrieve things
that the author meant

146
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,698
 when he wrote all that?
He...

147
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:34,276
That's going to be your
assignment for tomorrow.

148
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:37,751
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismiss.

149
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,950
- Alex, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

150
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:42,853
You look... well.
It's been a while.

151
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,777
It has.
You're not too bad yourself.

152
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:45,924
Thank you.

153
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,334
This is my brother, Scott.

154
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,373
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the school for the gifted.

155
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,688
Yeah.
It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

156
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,522
It never does, not at first.

157
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,841
The first step in understanding
one's power is learning the extent of it.

158
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:07,087
Only then, can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

159
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,163
If you do decide to stay,

160
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:12,042
I can promise you that by
the time you are done here

161
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,255
you'll be able to go back into the world
and play a stable productive partner.

162
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,207
Why don't you take your bandages off
and we can have a look

163
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,201
at what we're dealing with here.

164
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,779
Alex, would you line him up.
Face him in the right direction if you will.

165
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,425
There's a target just across the water.

166
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,886
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

167
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,741
You can open your eyes, Scott.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

168
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,195
It's quite...

169
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,611
Get back!

170
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,386
Get back.
Get back.

171
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,572
Whoa!

172
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,326
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was 5 years old.

173
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:57,222
I used to swing from
the branches then myself.

174
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,620
I think that was probably
my favourite tree.

175
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,999
- Does that mean I'm expel?
- On the contrary.

176
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:09,635
You're enrolled.

177
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,181
Do you sell rugs?

178
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,553
You're not allowed in this area.

179
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,500
This rug is for sale?

180
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,153
I said, this...

181
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,574
Good morning.

182
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:26,397
Oh, mighty lord.

183
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:31,354
Bless us with your powers.
Bless us with your powers.

184
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,195
The great,
all mighty lord.

185
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,532
Bless us with your powers.
Bless us with your powers.

186
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:44,744
We are your loyal followers.

187
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,639
- En Sabah Nur.
- En Sabah Nur.

188
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:51,396
The great,
all mighty lord.

189
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:55,286
Bless us with your powers.
Bless us with your authorities.

190
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:56,762
Look, quick.

191
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:59,232
Everyone, look.

192
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,844
En Sabah Nur.

193
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,214
The great,
all mighty lord.

194
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:08,853
Bless us with your powers.
Bless us with your authorities.

195
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:11,158
- En Sabah Nur!
- En Sabah Nur!

196
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,985
The great,
all mighty lord.

197
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,753
Bless us with your powers.
Bless us with your authorities.

198
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:10,036
Lord!

199
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,574
What's happening?

200
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:18,410
- En Sabah Nur!
- En Sabah Nur!

201
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,929
Something's wrong.
No. No.

202
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:32,858
- Run!
- Quick, run!

203
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:09,667
Earthquake!

204
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,121
Back to bed, please, my darling.

205
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:57,785
- Back to bed.
- She's doing it again.

206
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,714
Back to bed, please, everyone.
Jessie, back to bed, please.

207
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,520
Come on, now.
Spitzbolt, back to bed.

208
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:05,235
Carrie Anne, come on, now.
Back to bed.

209
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,257
- I've never seen her like this.
- Well, I do.

210
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:19,454
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

211
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,785
Jean.

212
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:04,520
Jean!

213
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:08,183
JEAN !!!

214
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,401
I...
I saw the end of the world.

215
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,510
I could feel all this death.

216
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,101
Nope.
It was just a dream.

217
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:29,428
- But, it felt real.
- I know.

218
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,067
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

219
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:36,026
- It can convince itself...
- No, it's not

220
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:40,610
just a mind reading or the telekinesis,
it's something else.

221
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:48,555
Some... dark power inside
and it's growing, like a fire.

222
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,545
- I thought I was getting better.
- You are. You will.

223
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,427
- You just have to be patient.
- No. No.

224
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:58,379
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

225
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:02,926
- To be trapped inside your own head.
- Oh, but I think I do.

226
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:07,066
It wasn't so long ago,
that I was plagued by voices of myself.

227
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,138
All their suffering.
All their pain.

228
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:13,339
Their secrets.

229
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,424
I'm afraid one day
I am going to hurt someone.

230
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,808
Lie back.

231
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:38,095
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

232
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:42,183
You will learn to control your powers.

233
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:47,245
And when you do,
you'll have nothing to fear.

234
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:50,696
Her nightmares were different this time.

235
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:53,524
Well, it could have count for something
I saw while I was in my lab earlier.

236
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:56,129
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

237
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:59,238
- I picked it up on one of my meters.
- You're saying that Jean created it.

238
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:00,787
No, I'm saying something else did.

239
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,163
Maybe she was reacting to it,
I don't know.

240
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,007
But, the Epicenter was
half way around the world.

241
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:06,597
- Half way around the world?
- Yeah.

242
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,251
That's why I was hoping
you could take a look.

243
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:10,374
Let's see what we can find.

244
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,350
<font color="#ff80c0">Welcome Professor.</font>

245
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,968
The source came from Cairo.

246
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:31,276
I'll put in the coordinates.

247
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,401
I got to get out of here
and report everything.

248
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,606
What?
What is it?

249
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:06,380
Something happened here,
I must make a report.

250
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:10,659
- It's her.
- Who?

251
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,003
- Moira.
- What?

252
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,012
- Moira MacTaggert?
- Mm-hm.

253
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,526
- Eh, give me the details?
- Well, she looks amazing.

254
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:21,073
- She's barely aged a day.
- No. I meant...

255
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:23,683
What is she doing there?
What's the CIA doing with this?

256
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,708
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

257
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:29,112
I'm going to go there,

258
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:31,292
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

259
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:32,949
You want to go see Moira.

260
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:36,684
I want to go check her out,
check out... the situation.

261
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,064
Moira MacTaggert.

262
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:46,033
It's like a ghost from the past.

263
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:50,215
You did a good thing,
you saved that man.

264
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,975
That's not the point.

265
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,039
If I'm exposed,
we're all exposed.

266
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,777
We have to go.

267
00:30:55,802 --> 00:30:57,842
This is our home.

268
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,677
This is our daughter's home.

269
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:02,091
We are our home.

270
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:06,660
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

271
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:11,190
I trusted you then.
I need you to trust me now.

272
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,314
We can't stay here anymore.

273
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:20,692
I'll get Nina.

274
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,389
Sweetheart?

275
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:36,248
She's not in her room.

276
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:38,416
And I don't see her
out the back.

277
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:48,794
- Nina!
- Nina!

278
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:51,314
- Nina!
- Nina!

279
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,930
Nina!

280
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,259
Nina.

281
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:22,162
Are you alright?

282
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,405
She's fine.

283
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,201
- Then, let her go.
- We will.

284
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:29,152
We just wanted to have a word.

285
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,296
You are not wearing your badges.

286
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:36,295
No metal.

287
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:40,232
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

288
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,694
Something that didn't add up.

289
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,256
Put your weapons away.

290
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,931
You've been a good citizen, Henryk.

291
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:49,391
A good neighbor, good worker.

292
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,465
- I want to believe that's who you are.
- He is.

293
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,180
But nobody in this town
really knows you.

294
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,933
Yes, you do.

295
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,793
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

296
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:02,482
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

297
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:04,679
And you were lying the whole time.

298
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:07,357
I brought a killer into my house.

299
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:10,806
Is that you?

300
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,085
Are you the one they call Magneto?

301
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,994
Take me in.

302
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,481
Please.
Just let my daughter go.

303
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,461
Go with your mother.

304
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,493
Please!

305
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,015
Don't leave me.

306
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,665
- I'm not going to let them take you.
- Nina.

307
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:14,124
Nina.
Please. Please.

308
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:18,079
Nina. Nina, don't.
Nina.

309
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:19,147
Please!

310
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:20,461
What's going on?

311
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:22,372
She's one of them.

312
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:23,866
Please.

313
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,141
Tell her to stop.

314
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,359
She can't control it.

315
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:27,853
- Nina.
- Please.

316
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:29,316
She's scared of you.

317
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:34,531
I'm not going to let them take you!
I'm not going to let them take you!

318
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,461
Make her stop!

319
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,541
Nina.
Nina.

320
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:45,875
Please stop.

321
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,528
Please stop, Nina!

322
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,304
No!

323
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:05,935
Nina?

324
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,619
Nina.
No.

325
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:09,970
No...
Please. Please. Please.

326
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:12,386
- What have you done?
- Don't leave me, plese.

327
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:17,910
Please.
Please.

328
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,266
Not my babies.

329
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,118
Not my babies.

330
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,078
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

331
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,274
Is this what I am?

332
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,987
Is this what I am?

333
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:38,240
God damn thief.
Stop that thief.

334
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:44,176
Stop her.
Stop that thief!

335
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,744
You know what we do to thieves?

336
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,092
Pick a hand.

337
00:37:50,117 --> 00:37:51,757
Enough.

338
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,567
If you are with her,
I suggest you walk away.

339
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:58,795
While you can.

340
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:02,383
Walk away.

341
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,442
Who rules this world?

342
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,440
What language is that?

343
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:14,393
Clown-face!
What do you want?

344
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,160
Beat it!

345
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:32,778
I'm sorry.

346
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,201
I'm sorry.

347
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:42,459
You can't feel it, don't you?

348
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:57,861
Now, you feel it.

349
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,008
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

350
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,258
So, you really haven't
seen her in all these years?

351
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,616
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

352
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:11,894
Alex.

353
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,408
Who do you take me for?
Some kind of pervert?

354
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,078
I...
Yes, I looked her up once.

355
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,491
Twice.
But, not in a long time. Alright?

356
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:19,244
How'd you leave things?

357
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,524
- Any hard feelings?
- Not likely.

358
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,511
Everybody take a break.

359
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:27,734
I wiped her mind off
all memories of us.

360
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:30,758
The beach, Cuba,
the whole thing.

361
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:32,874
It's so long ago, Alex.

362
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:35,390
Before the world knew about mutants,
I have felt...

363
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,377
it was the best thing for her.

364
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:40,074
And for you?

365
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:45,041
It didn't really matter
what's best for me.

366
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:52,623
Moira MacTaggert.
Hello.

367
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:56,477
Oh, Jeez.
What the devil?

368
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:58,580
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Professor...

369
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,024
Charles Xavier.

370
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,466
- I know exactly who you are
- You do?

371
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:04,027
Of course I do.

372
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:09,637
I've read all of your papers.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

373
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,562
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Alex Summers.

374
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:14,788
Have a seat.
Just, throw that on the floor.

375
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,556
It's wonderful to see you again.

376
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,767
To-To meet you again
for the first time.

377
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,565
I...
You got a son?

378
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,754
- Yes.
- Does he have a husband or...

379
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:28,889
Do you have a husband?

380
00:40:28,914 --> 00:40:31,134
I had a husband, but...

381
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,511
It's hard to do this job and
make it home in time for dinner.

382
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,507
Good.
Good.

383
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,873
We all make choices, right?

384
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:39,226
Yes, we do.

385
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:43,842
- Professor.
- Yes?

386
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,224
Yes. I was... we were hoping

387
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:50,692
that you would tell us about
what happened yesterday in Egypt.

388
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:53,411
I'm afraid that's classified information.

389
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:56,261
And, I don't mean to be rude,
but...

390
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,715
How did you get in here?

391
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,216
I have level 5 clearance.

392
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:05,487
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73,

393
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:09,164
there have been cults who see them
as some kind of second coming

394
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:10,894
or sign of god.

395
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:13,188
I was tracking one of them.

396
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:16,191
They called themselves,
Ashir En Sabah Nur,

397
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:19,817
named after an ancient being
they believed to be the world's first.

398
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:21,426
The world first's what?

399
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:23,416
The world's first mutant.

400
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,610
I thought mutants didn't
evolve until this century.

401
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:28,363
That's the common theory, yes.
But, these guys believe that

402
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:31,516
the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

403
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,957
And they believe he will rise again.

404
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:38,188
They've been searching ancient sites
all round the world for clues.

405
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:43,341
These hieroglyphs described a specific set
of powers greater than any man can possess.

406
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,372
They think he lived all that time?

407
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:47,478
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability

408
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:50,175
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body,

409
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,219
and whenever he was close to death
he would just take on a new body.

410
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,795
Some of these may have been the bodies of
mutants enabling him to take their powers

411
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,340
amassing varies abilities over the years.

412
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:02,165
- An all powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

413
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,617
And wherever this being was,
he always had 4 principle followers.

414
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:10,065
Disciples.
Protectors he would imbue their powers.

415
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,681
Like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

416
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:17,398
- He got that one from the Bible.
- Or the Bible got it from him.

417
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:22,707
And wherever he ruled,
eventually, it would end in disaster.

418
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:28,260
Cataclysm.
Some kind of... Apocalypse.

419
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,166
The end of the world.

420
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:34,082
I must say, Apollo.

421
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:37,694
The way you ape
human behavior is remarkable.

422
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,247
Get out, children.

423
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:40,734
Come on.
Come on.

424
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,654
Get out.
Get out.

425
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:48,488
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

426
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:51,576
You speak Egyptian?
Arabic?

427
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:53,239
English?

428
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:58,249
Great fighter.

429
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:02,911
She's my hero.
I want to be like her.

430
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,718
There's some food here,
not much.

431
00:43:07,743 --> 00:43:10,898
I don't believe it.
You love me.

432
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:14,898
Love you?
Be logical.

433
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:18,704
I'm not some simple
shepherdess you can awe.

434
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:23,757
Why, I could no more love you than
I could love a new species of...

435
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,744
Bacteria.

436
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:27,984
What are you doing?

437
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,217
Learning.

438
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:43,713
In the streets there is outrage against
the invasion of Afghanistan...

439
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:46,128
The brotherhood of our kind.

440
00:43:47,137 --> 00:43:49,640
One of them was held in Boston.

441
00:43:50,302 --> 00:43:54,782
Since the act in the nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights...

442
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:56,181
Weapons.

443
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:58,699
Never before has man
possess so much power.

444
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:02,474
With Soviet Union and the
United States being superpowers...

445
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:06,683
Superpowers.

446
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:11,592
The weak have taken the Earth.

447
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:15,292
For this, I was betrayed.

448
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:17,790
False gods.

449
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:20,543
Idols.

450
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,734
No more.

451
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,859
I have returned.

452
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:36,248
The new tomorrow,
that starts today.

453
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:42,446
Where did you come from?

454
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,894
The time before man lost his way.

455
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:57,299
Well.
Welcome to the 80s.

456
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:01,371
This world needs to be...

457
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,707
Cleansed.

458
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:05,741
What?

459
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,064
Saved.

460
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:13,986
You can't save the world,
just going around killing people.

461
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,800
There's laws, systems and place
for that kind of thing.

462
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:24,956
My child, why do you enslave yourself?

463
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:32,937
- What are you doing?
- Making you stronger.

464
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:35,936
My goddess.

465
00:45:45,613 --> 00:45:47,942
Yes.

466
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,266
You were right.

467
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:54,838
The time has passed.

468
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:58,310
There is no room for gods.

469
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,706
- Why can't I go with you.
- I told you, I work alone.

470
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:13,916
Wait there.

471
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:19,194
Always good to see your face,
even if it's not yours.

472
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:21,539
Papers and passage for me.

473
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:25,744
Where is the gentleman going,
may I ask?

474
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:27,589
Don't matter, don't care.

475
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:30,187
I just saved his life, what
he does with it is up to him.

476
00:46:30,212 --> 00:46:33,336
- Mystique, the mercenary.
- Don't call me that.

477
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:35,514
No matter how much you
pretend to be someone else,

478
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,184
Caliban knows who you are.

479
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:41,463
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants, Caliban knows it.

480
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:43,597
Mystique.

481
00:46:43,622 --> 00:46:46,840
Why don't you ask your psychics
what will happen if you keep pushing me.

482
00:46:46,865 --> 00:46:48,670
What will happen?

483
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,424
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

484
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:58,749
- 'Cause Caliban likes you.
- Caliban likes money.

485
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:03,072
Caliban likes you so much,
he wants to give you free information.

486
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,321
About an old friend.

487
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:07,250
From back when you have friends.

488
00:47:07,275 --> 00:47:12,224
Do you remember, Erik Lehnsherr?

489
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,188
My girls had a flash
of him in Poland.

490
00:47:14,213 --> 00:47:16,458
He left quite a few
dead bodies in his wake,

491
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:19,655
including his wife and daughter.

492
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,718
Should be on the news soon enough.

493
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:25,452
But...
Caliban gives you a little head start.

494
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,833
How fast are you?

495
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,571
- How fast?
- How far can you cover?

496
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,110
Uh, as far as I can see,

497
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,399
- or if I've been there before.
- Come with me Crawler.

498
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:37,908
Actually it's Nightcrawler,
and my real name is...

499
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:40,565
... Kurt Wagner.

500
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:47,010
The lenses are made up of some
ruby quartz I have lying around.

501
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:48,809
They should be able to refract
your optic beams

502
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,557
and keep them contain
within their own vector fields.

503
00:47:51,582 --> 00:47:53,067
Try them on.

504
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,732
Okay, go ahead.

505
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:13,272
Wait. Wait.
Sorry, no.

506
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:14,302
Okay.

507
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:15,325
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

508
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,605
Alright.

509
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:21,653
Whoa.

510
00:48:22,992 --> 00:48:24,644
I can see.

511
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,014
Thank you.

512
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:28,033
Professor, thank you.
You're a genius.

513
00:48:28,058 --> 00:48:31,327
No, I'm... not a professor.

514
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:32,663
I wish.

515
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:35,684
Who's that?

516
00:48:37,694 --> 00:48:39,341
I believe you two have met,
that's Jean Grey.

517
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:40,954
You bumped into her
when you arrived.

518
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:43,453
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

519
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:49,939
Hey.

520
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,988
You can see.

521
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:57,050
Yeah.
It's not as bad as I thought here.

522
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:59,565
- Freak.
- Some one should warn that new kid.

523
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,495
They're still scared of me.

524
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,623
Hey, I have special glasses now!

525
00:49:03,648 --> 00:49:06,309
They're not scared of you,
they're scared of me.

526
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,921
You're not the only one who
can't full control your powers.

527
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:12,781
Wait, so...

528
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:16,922
Last night, when the house shook...
That was you?

529
00:49:16,947 --> 00:49:20,520
Sorry to break it to you, but you are
not the biggest freak of this school.

530
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:23,499
Well.
That's a first.

531
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,022
Raven.

532
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:44,372
Wow.
Uh.

533
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:47,789
- I... You're...
- Not blue?

534
00:49:47,814 --> 00:49:49,864
It's like you and I have
that in common now.

535
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:53,022
No. No, I meant...
You're...

536
00:49:53,734 --> 00:49:55,401
You're back.

537
00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:58,743
I never thought I would
see you here again.

538
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,967
Yeah, me neither.

539
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:06,242
I'm blue.

540
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:07,806
I'm Kurt.

541
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:09,514
Oh, right.

542
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,526
Kurt Wagner.

543
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:13,059
Welcome.

544
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:17,493
We're closed.

545
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:23,241
I knew I felt
a chill in the air.

546
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:26,720
How did you get in here?

547
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:28,090
We let ourselves in.

548
00:50:28,115 --> 00:50:29,746
We are looking for mutants.

549
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,964
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

550
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,422
Caliban doesn't know you.

551
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:39,513
We are looking for the strongest.

552
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,641
- Everything alright?
- I'm fine, Psylocke.

553
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:48,360
How much money do you have?

554
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:50,020
None.

555
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:52,283
Like Caliban said...

556
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,128
We are closed, yeah?

557
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:58,903
I need your help, my child.

558
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:01,529
You don't look Caliban's father.

559
00:51:01,554 --> 00:51:04,193
Maybe a little bit up here.

560
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,398
You are all my children.

561
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:17,453
And you are lost, because
you follow blind leaders.

562
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:20,140
These false gods.

563
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:23,253
Systems of the weak.

564
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:26,077
They ruined my world...

565
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:28,087
... no more.

566
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:37,621
What do you want?

567
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,211
I want you...

568
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:53,984
To feel the full reach
of your power.

569
00:51:58,102 --> 00:52:01,261
You've only have a taste
of your true strength.

570
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:05,657
Unlike others who seek to control you.

571
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:08,494
I want to set you free.

572
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,921
I know the kind of mutants
you are looking for.

573
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,781
And I know where to find them.

574
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:29,882
It's my first time in America.

575
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:31,998
I am very excited
to see your culture.

576
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,043
Well, you are not
going to see it here.

577
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,485
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

578
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:39,079
This is Scott.

579
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,041
He is new here too.

580
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:43,418
And I'm already up
for a prison break.

581
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:47,370
What do you say we take this
blue guy on a little field trip?

582
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:49,909
I'm sure there's a mall
around here somewhere.

583
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,763
What's a mall?

584
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:55,636
What's a mall? Alright.
Now it's a matter of national pride.

585
00:52:55,661 --> 00:52:57,948
- Civic duty.
- Scott.

586
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,909
What? You've been cooped up
here for a long time.

587
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:03,259
And the Professor is not even home.

588
00:53:03,793 --> 00:53:06,185
I-I like to go to the mall.

589
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:10,217
- Try it.
- Alright.

590
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:12,190
Where does he keep his cars?

591
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:26,867
Faire pisse.

592
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:29,507
Or should I say, "Piss off"?

593
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:37,367
- This is the guy?
- He used to be.

594
00:53:37,392 --> 00:53:39,658
I didn't know his wings were...

595
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:45,002
Let's get out of here.

596
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:47,192
His fighting days are done.

597
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:49,019
No, they're not.

598
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:56,807
What the hell is this?

599
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,932
I want to give you something.

600
00:54:00,957 --> 00:54:04,054
There is nothing you can
give me that I want.

601
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,367
Yes, there is.

602
00:54:20,614 --> 00:54:23,907
Yes, my son.

603
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,789
Yes.

604
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:53,168
Rise, my angel.

605
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:57,627
Rise.

606
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:33,153
Hypersonic, blast resistance,
stealth technology.

607
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:34,974
That's impressive.

608
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:38,062
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

609
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:42,737
Well, that's okay. I built a
retractable roof into the basketball court.

610
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,431
Hank, you're building
a warplane down here.

611
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:48,473
After what happened in Washington,

612
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:50,442
I thought we would come back
to start the X-Men.

613
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:53,072
Like we always talked about, but...

614
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:55,439
Charles wants students
not soldiers.

615
00:55:55,464 --> 00:55:58,569
He thinks the best of people.
He has hope.

616
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:00,167
And you?

617
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:03,246
You know, I think
we should hope for the best.

618
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:06,296
And prepare for the worst.

619
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,680
I think the world needs the X-Men.

620
00:56:10,557 --> 00:56:13,454
Maybe, now that you're back
you can help me convince him

621
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:15,957
- ... we can start it together.
- Hank, I'm here about Erik.

622
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:20,617
Right. Erik.
Yeah, of course.

623
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:21,641
Of course.

624
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:24,117
I think he might be in
some kind of trouble.

625
00:56:24,142 --> 00:56:25,960
Real trouble.

626
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,894
Isn't he always?

627
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,267
Some of you spoke to the police...

628
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:09,004
About what your believed
you witnessed here yesterday.

629
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:13,959
You want to know my past?

630
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,162
Know who I am?

631
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,237
See what I can do?

632
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:23,909
I'll show you.

633
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:30,055
Think about the person
you love most in your life.

634
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,523
Your wife.

635
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,514
Mother.

636
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:42,014
Daughter.

637
00:57:46,155 --> 00:57:50,317
Now that person will know what
it is to lose someone they love.

638
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:53,103
And live with that pain.

639
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:57,425
- Forever.
- Henryk, please.

640
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,269
Don't do it.

641
00:57:59,963 --> 00:58:02,137
My name isn't Henryk.

642
00:58:05,738 --> 00:58:08,106
My name is Magneto.

643
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,872
Who the fuck are you?

644
00:58:33,062 --> 00:58:35,045
Stay back.

645
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:38,781
Whoever you are,

646
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,358
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

647
00:59:00,434 --> 00:59:02,485
I'm not here for them.

648
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:06,097
I'm here for you.

649
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:24,888
Come and see.

650
00:59:57,847 --> 01:00:01,142
This is where your power was born.

651
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:06,239
And this is where your
people were slaughtered.

652
01:00:21,073 --> 01:00:23,547
You shouldn't have brought me here.

653
01:00:25,537 --> 01:00:27,259
Why?

654
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:31,569
Are you afraid to be here?

655
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:35,861
You can't escape it, Erik.

656
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,208
Who are you?

657
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:42,910
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

658
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:47,091
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

659
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:50,710
I am born of death.

660
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:55,339
I was there to spark and fan
the flame of man's awakening,

661
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:58,067
to spin the wheel of civilization.

662
01:00:58,092 --> 01:01:02,633
And when the forest would grow rank
and in need of clearing for new growth...

663
01:01:02,874 --> 01:01:07,154
I was there to set it ablaze.

664
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,459
Where were you?

665
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:12,272
When my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

666
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:13,654
Asleep.

667
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,242
Trapped in darkness.

668
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:18,201
I was not there for you, my son.

669
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:20,785
But I am here now.

670
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,586
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

671
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:30,232
Reach down.

672
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:33,465
Feel the metal in the ground.

673
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:37,177
Reach, as deep as you can.

674
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:45,065
You'll find you have the power
to move the very Earth itself.

675
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:23,325
Everything they've built will fall!

676
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:27,503
And from the ashes of their world,

677
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,291
we'll build a better one!

678
01:02:58,056 --> 01:03:02,537
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday
in this small town, in central Poland.

679
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:06,558
Leaders from all communities are
urging their citizens to remain calm

680
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,899
as police and armed forces
are mobilizing

681
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:11,303
to find Lehnsherr before
he can strike again.

682
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:14,403
If anyone has information about Lehnsherr,

683
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:16,770
or as he is also known as Magneto.

684
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:19,527
Contact you local authorities immediately.

685
01:03:19,552 --> 01:03:21,448
And proceed with caution.

686
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:24,876
- As he is considered extremely dangerous.
- Peter.

687
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,405
What's up?

688
01:03:29,379 --> 01:03:32,762
- I'm just checking on you.
- I'm good, playing Pac-Man.

689
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:39,893
Are you sure
you weren't watching this?

690
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:43,940
The world was celebrating 10 years of
peace between mutants and man kind.

691
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:46,283
You're going after him, aren't you?

692
01:03:47,314 --> 01:03:50,028
You wanted me to get out
of the house more, right?

693
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:53,248
I can't stop you.
Nobody can.

694
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:55,726
Trust me.
This won't end well.

695
01:03:56,388 --> 01:03:58,638
Nothing does with him.

696
01:04:01,873 --> 01:04:03,572
I'm not afraid of him.

697
01:04:03,597 --> 01:04:05,416
You should be.

698
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,910
XAVIER'S SCHOOL
FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS

699
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,201
I've read so much about this place.

700
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:38,061
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

701
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:39,511
... familiar.

702
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:42,154
- It's strange.
- It could be quite.

703
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,124
Shall we?

704
01:04:44,149 --> 01:04:44,887
NOW PLAYING
THE RETURN OF THE JEDI

705
01:04:44,888 --> 01:04:46,978
I'm just saying,
"The Empire" is still the best.

706
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:49,525
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated,

707
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,203
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

708
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:52,826
Yeah, but come on. If it
wasn't for the first one

709
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,451
you wouldn't have any of
the rest of the movies.

710
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:58,200
Well, at least we can all agree
the third one is always the worst.

711
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,577
Hank.
You in here?

712
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:02,881
I'd like you to meet the...

713
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,422
Moira.

714
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:06,978
Raven?

715
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,369
I'm sorry, have we met?

716
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:15,905
Hank, Alex, agent MacTaggert, would
you give us just one moment please?

717
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:18,003
Of course.

718
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,794
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

719
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,866
Well. After you left me
on the beach in Cuba,

720
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:30,160
I took her memories of that time.
Have a sit.

721
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:31,982
Lucky girl.

722
01:05:34,149 --> 01:05:37,009
It's good to see you, Raven.

723
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,485
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my house.

724
01:05:40,255 --> 01:05:41,406
It was once.

725
01:05:41,431 --> 01:05:44,311
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

726
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:46,255
I barely even recognize it now.

727
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,887
Yeah, I have plans for this place.

728
01:05:49,332 --> 01:05:51,361
I mean to turn it
into a real campus.

729
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:56,197
A university. Not just for mutants,
even for humans too.

730
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,475
Living and working,

731
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,527
... growing together.

732
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:03,085
You know, I really believed that once.

733
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,270
I really believed we can
change them after DC.

734
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:07,337
We did.

735
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:09,591
No Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

736
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:11,899
It's just harder to see because
they're more polite about it.

737
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,561
I got sick of living that lie.

738
01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:16,598
That's why you're not
in your natural blue form.

739
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:19,828
I'm not going to be the face
of a world that doesn't exist.

740
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:22,686
Things are better.
The world is better.

741
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:24,916
Maybe in Westchester.

742
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:29,562
Out there, mutants are still running,
hiding, living in fear.

743
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:32,924
Just because there's not a war
doesn't mean there's peace.

744
01:06:32,925 --> 01:06:34,820
If you want to teach your kids
something, teach them that.

745
01:06:34,845 --> 01:06:36,111
Teach them to fight.

746
01:06:36,136 --> 01:06:38,414
Otherwise, they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

747
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:43,122
You still sound just like him.
You sound just like Erik.

748
01:06:44,805 --> 01:06:46,638
That's why I'm here.

749
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:49,039
He's resurfaced.

750
01:06:50,986 --> 01:06:54,834
He had a wife and a daughter.
They were killed.

751
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:57,855
Along with a handful of policemen.

752
01:06:59,874 --> 01:07:02,071
The whole world
will be looking for him.

753
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:05,071
But you can help me
find him before they do.

754
01:07:13,806 --> 01:07:16,691
Moira, I'm going to have to
ask you to keep this a secret.

755
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:19,790
I don't even know
what this... is.

756
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,694
It's Cerebro.

757
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:25,019
- The new model.
- Yeah. I based the color on...

758
01:07:27,053 --> 01:07:28,726
It doesn't matter.

759
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:47,554
What are those?

760
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:50,214
Those are all the humans
of the world.

761
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:53,843
And these...

762
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:56,414
... are all the mutants.

763
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,588
I'm connected to all of their minds.

764
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:02,075
The CIA would kill for this.

765
01:08:02,076 --> 01:08:04,060
I know they would.

766
01:08:06,355 --> 01:08:08,420
Where are you, Erik?

767
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:42,049
Charles?

768
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:44,915
Hello, old friend.

769
01:08:47,441 --> 01:08:49,442
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

770
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:51,469
I feel your pain.

771
01:08:52,602 --> 01:08:54,716
And your loss.

772
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,702
You think, because
you can see into my head...

773
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:01,190
... you know how it feels?

774
01:09:01,682 --> 01:09:04,254
You are looking in the wrong place, Charles.

775
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:07,401
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

776
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:12,367
But, come back to us.
I can help you.

777
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,625
Help me?

778
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:16,859
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

779
01:09:16,884 --> 01:09:20,176
- What would they have wanted?
- They would have wanted to live.

780
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:23,747
I tried your way, Charles.

781
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:26,742
I tried to be like them.

782
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,944
Live like them.

783
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:34,825
But it always ends the same way.

784
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:38,992
They took everything away from me.

785
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,014
Now...

786
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:50,703
We'll take everything from them.

787
01:09:57,975 --> 01:09:59,491
Hank.

788
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:03,257
He's not alone.

789
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,719
Extraordinary.

790
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:15,728
What do you see?

791
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,280
The answer.

792
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,854
Oh my god.

793
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:42,284
Thank you for letting me in.

794
01:10:46,944 --> 01:10:48,793
Charles.
Charles, get out!

795
01:10:48,818 --> 01:10:50,181
Charles?

796
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,160
I have never felt
power like this before.

797
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,225
Charles.
Charles, get out!

798
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,032
What's going on?
What's happening?

799
01:10:58,057 --> 01:10:59,701
I think...

800
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:01,247
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

801
01:11:01,272 --> 01:11:03,708
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

802
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:06,935
To connect.

803
01:11:15,411 --> 01:11:18,313
It's always the same.

804
01:11:18,615 --> 01:11:22,121
And now all this.

805
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:28,510
No more stones.

806
01:11:30,322 --> 01:11:33,583
Not more spears.

807
01:11:39,748 --> 01:11:43,433
No more slings.

808
01:11:46,582 --> 01:11:49,575
No more swords.

809
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,137
No more weapons!

810
01:11:53,162 --> 01:11:56,838
No more systems!

811
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,745
No more!

812
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:03,636
No more superpowers.

813
01:12:04,478 --> 01:12:06,222
Charles!

814
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,425
Hank!

815
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,987
What the hell is going on?

816
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,390
Who's turning the keys?

817
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:34,118
The men are.

818
01:12:34,143 --> 01:12:35,627
Who agreed with the launch?

819
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,763
Hank, do something!

820
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:44,431
It won't shut down!

821
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,285
We've lost contact with the
Trident and Polaris subs.

822
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:51,203
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

823
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:55,015
So much faith in their... tools

824
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,722
and their... machines.

825
01:12:57,747 --> 01:13:02,138
Russia, China, England,
Israel, India.

826
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:04,297
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

827
01:13:04,322 --> 01:13:06,495
What's the target?
Where are they going?

828
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,553
Up.
Straight up.

829
01:13:08,577 --> 01:13:10,042
- Alex.
- What?

830
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:11,191
Destroy it!

831
01:13:11,216 --> 01:13:14,280
Destroy everything.
Destroy Cerebro!

832
01:13:17,963 --> 01:13:19,881
Wreak havoc.

833
01:13:23,718 --> 01:13:28,815
You can fire your arrows
from the Tower of Babel.

834
01:13:37,567 --> 01:13:43,811
BUT YOU CAN NEVER STRIKE GOD!

835
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:02,066
Charles.
Charles, are you okay?

836
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,489
Erik.

837
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:26,022
Charles!

838
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:28,404
Alex!

839
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:30,621
Hey!
Hey, asshole!

840
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:33,137
All will be revealed, my child.

841
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:34,387
Stop!

842
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:35,884
NO!

843
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,078
Wow!

844
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,160
Where...
Where did you...?

845
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:41,881
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

846
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:47,205
They took him away.

847
01:17:47,798 --> 01:17:50,083
She's the one.
That's her.

848
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,801
Are you sure?

849
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:54,250
Is she going to help us?

850
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,090
They look up to you.

851
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:10,743
Right now.

852
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:12,612
They need you.

853
01:18:15,703 --> 01:18:17,784
That's not what they need.

854
01:18:19,003 --> 01:18:21,052
Whoa!
That's far out.

855
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,862
What happened?
Where's Alex?

856
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:33,359
Where's my brother?

857
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:35,670
I'm pretty sure I got everybody.

858
01:18:37,752 --> 01:18:40,408
Alex was closest to the blast.

859
01:18:56,184 --> 01:18:57,671
Alex.

860
01:19:19,224 --> 01:19:21,172
We're 1 click out.

861
01:19:21,364 --> 01:19:23,574
Alright, boys.
This is it.

862
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,635
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</font>

863
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,769
Scott.

864
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:30,994
<font color="#ff80c0">Medical assistance is on the way.</font>

865
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,246
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</font>

866
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:37,590
<font color="#ff80c0">Medical assistance is on the way.</font>

867
01:19:38,245 --> 01:19:40,483
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</font>

868
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:43,725
<font color="#ff80c0">Medical assistance is on the way.</font>

869
01:19:44,857 --> 01:19:47,116
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</font>

870
01:19:47,141 --> 01:19:50,474
<font color="#ff80c0">Medical assistance is on the way.</font>

871
01:19:52,263 --> 01:19:53,287
Hey!

872
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:57,420
Moira MacTaggert, CIA!
Thank God you're here!

873
01:20:02,536 --> 01:20:04,147
WAIT !

874
01:20:04,172 --> 01:20:05,764
Fire!

875
01:20:10,923 --> 01:20:12,626
I want her!

876
01:20:14,467 --> 01:20:15,767
Him!

877
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:18,101
Him!

878
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:27,681
- And her!
- Yes, sir.

879
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:33,373
Leave the kids.

880
01:20:39,557 --> 01:20:41,904
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

881
01:20:42,633 --> 01:20:45,776
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a
final sweep on the ground.

882
01:20:53,168 --> 01:20:55,178
Alright, let's get them on the bird!

883
01:20:55,203 --> 01:20:56,711
Clear!

884
01:20:58,031 --> 01:21:00,223
Pack them up.
Let's go.

885
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,257
Come on, let's move!

886
01:21:02,282 --> 01:21:03,866
Thanks, Jean.

887
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:05,521
We got to help them.

888
01:21:05,546 --> 01:21:08,089
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there?

889
01:21:08,121 --> 01:21:09,336
What if the soldiers see us?

890
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:11,977
Don't worry.
They won't see us, trust me.

891
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:15,488
Hold on.

892
01:21:30,707 --> 01:21:32,746
Kurt, get us all out of here!

893
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:35,659
I can't!

894
01:21:35,684 --> 01:21:39,359
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electric field.

895
01:21:39,384 --> 01:21:41,540
- It's like Berlin all over.
- Jean, get into the pilots heads.

896
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:43,022
- Don't let them take off!
- I can't.

897
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:46,255
I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

898
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,468
We're also getting reports
from Europe and Asia.

899
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,721
This was not just
the US phenomenon.

900
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,608
It seems the entire world has been
disarmed of nuclear weapons.

901
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:04,433
The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches from Russia,

902
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,499
as well as the UK,
Israel and China.

903
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:07,633
- Look!
- Up there.

904
01:22:07,634 --> 01:22:09,605
So far, there has been
no response from the White House.

905
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,536
Eye witness accounts have been pouring in
from across the globe.

906
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:18,455
Authorities are not sure if it was
an act of peace or an act of war.

907
01:22:24,454 --> 01:22:26,178
Dear Father.

908
01:22:26,892 --> 01:22:29,680
Hold me in the light of God.

909
01:22:33,585 --> 01:22:35,652
It should have been me.

910
01:22:36,586 --> 01:22:40,167
He was the one who's going to
do something with his life.

911
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:42,307
He was always the one.

912
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,944
That's not how he felt.

913
01:22:46,106 --> 01:22:50,484
He felt you were the one who's going to
do something special with your life.

914
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:54,001
That you're going to make
a difference in the world.

915
01:22:55,247 --> 01:22:57,471
Maybe even change it.

916
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,123
How did you know what he felt?

917
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:03,823
I know what everybody feels.

918
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,747
Hold me in the light of God.

919
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:25,056
Protect me from danger.

920
01:23:25,537 --> 01:23:28,356
Save me by your command.

921
01:23:28,941 --> 01:23:31,580
Listen to my prayer.

922
01:23:32,222 --> 01:23:34,779
And keep me safe.

923
01:24:09,204 --> 01:24:12,374
You're blocking me.
How?

924
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,821
I can shield their minds
from your power.

925
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:18,724
It's one of the many gifts I have
acquired through out the millennia.

926
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:23,786
But to... see...
inside a mind.

927
01:24:23,811 --> 01:24:25,907
To control it.

928
01:24:26,753 --> 01:24:28,992
That's your gift.

929
01:24:30,002 --> 01:24:32,012
You saw it, didn't you?

930
01:24:32,037 --> 01:24:34,618
The glory of what's to come.

931
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:38,034
Are you going to take part
in all this killing?

932
01:24:38,814 --> 01:24:40,590
Destruction?

933
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,267
- It's all I ever known.
- No, it isn't.

934
01:24:44,494 --> 01:24:48,385
- You've just forgotten.
- No, Charles, I remember.

935
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,940
Your way doesn't work.

936
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:55,939
I showed him a better way.
A better world.

937
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:59,920
No, you just tapped into his rage and pain.
That's all you've done.

938
01:25:00,059 --> 01:25:02,066
I told you from the moment I met you,

939
01:25:02,091 --> 01:25:06,294
there's more to you, Erik.
There is good in you too.

940
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,803
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles.

941
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,359
I buried it.

942
01:25:13,384 --> 01:25:15,365
With my family.

943
01:25:27,931 --> 01:25:29,090
- What?
- What?

944
01:25:29,115 --> 01:25:30,770
What's wrong with you?

945
01:25:30,795 --> 01:25:33,104
Is that going to
happen to all of us?

946
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:37,017
No, I just left my meds
in the house.

947
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:38,577
- What happened? Where we are?
- Hey.

948
01:25:38,602 --> 01:25:39,886
Hey!

949
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:42,568
- Hello, Mystique.
- Major Stryker.

950
01:25:42,593 --> 01:25:43,797
Colonel Stryker.

951
01:25:43,822 --> 01:25:45,661
I wouldn't get too close
to the wall if I were you.

952
01:25:45,686 --> 01:25:47,892
It may create some... discomfort.

953
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:51,218
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

954
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:52,963
I know who you are,
agent MacTaggert.

955
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:56,444
- You cannot keep me here in this...
- Actually, I can.

956
01:25:56,469 --> 01:26:00,518
A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.

957
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:03,746
That event emanated from
exactly where we found you.

958
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:06,625
At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.

959
01:26:06,657 --> 01:26:10,879
So, you're going to tell me.
Where is Charles Xavier?

960
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:13,492
It's not him
you should be worried about.

961
01:26:13,517 --> 01:26:17,247
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

962
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,359
If you let us out of here,
we can help you.

963
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:24,223
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

964
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:25,858
You can put on any face
that you want,

965
01:26:25,883 --> 01:26:29,069
but I know who you are.
What you are.

966
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:35,999
Hey, Moira.
Mm.

967
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:40,456
What did you mean when you said
someone more powerful than Charles?

968
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:44,179
Once he finished this,
we'll go from there.

969
01:26:50,401 --> 01:26:52,010
What's taking so long?

970
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:53,231
I can't get in.

971
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:56,016
It has a field around it
like the helicopter.

972
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:58,202
There's got to be a way
to cut the power.

973
01:26:58,226 --> 01:27:03,809
Charles, you will send a message
to every living mind.

974
01:27:03,834 --> 01:27:07,468
You will tell them that this Earth
will be laid waste.

975
01:27:07,493 --> 01:27:12,419
That it is I, En Sabah Nur,
who wreak this upon them.

976
01:27:17,711 --> 01:27:19,344
Now.

977
01:27:19,655 --> 01:27:22,975
Deliver my message.

978
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,848
Even if I wanted to,

979
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:28,559
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

980
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,357
You don't need a machine...
to amplify your powers.

981
01:27:35,935 --> 01:27:37,879
You have me.

982
01:27:50,936 --> 01:27:54,211
Guys, that could be
our way out of here.

983
01:27:57,758 --> 01:28:00,555
You know him?
Magneto.

984
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:03,022
I used to.

985
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:05,229
I'm not so sure anymore.

986
01:28:05,254 --> 01:28:06,696
What was he like?

987
01:28:06,721 --> 01:28:11,154
Was he... like they say he was?
Was he a...

988
01:28:11,682 --> 01:28:13,159
... bad guy?

989
01:28:13,184 --> 01:28:14,584
No.

990
01:28:15,313 --> 01:28:19,238
I mean, yeah.
He was...

991
01:28:20,548 --> 01:28:23,708
Why do you care so much? Did you
see his speech on TV or something?

992
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:26,318
Yeah, but...

993
01:28:30,307 --> 01:28:31,846
He's my father.

994
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:33,126
What?

995
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:34,889
- He and my mom, they...
- Yeah, I know.

996
01:28:34,914 --> 01:28:36,712
But...
Are you sure?

997
01:28:36,737 --> 01:28:40,236
Yeah. Yeah. yeah.
He left my mom before I was born.

998
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:43,236
I met him 10 years back,
but I didn't know it was him.

999
01:28:43,261 --> 01:28:46,091
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late, you know.

1000
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:47,878
Then, this week I saw him
on TV again.

1001
01:28:47,903 --> 01:28:50,889
And, I came to their house
looking for him.

1002
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:53,615
But, by the time I got there...

1003
01:28:55,606 --> 01:28:57,340
Late again.

1004
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,131
You know, for a guy
who moves as fast as me,

1005
01:29:01,156 --> 01:29:03,685
I always seem to be too late.

1006
01:29:04,478 --> 01:29:06,749
Let's hope not this time.

1007
01:29:07,504 --> 01:29:09,549
Yeah.
Seriously.

1008
01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:13,346
Hear me,
inhabitants of this world.

1009
01:29:13,371 --> 01:29:15,564
- What is this?
- This is a message.

1010
01:29:15,565 --> 01:29:16,976
I think it's the Professor.

1011
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:21,368
A message to every man,
woman and mutant.

1012
01:29:21,393 --> 01:29:25,006
You have lost your way.

1013
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:27,497
You have lost your way.

1014
01:29:27,522 --> 01:29:29,903
But I have returned.

1015
01:29:29,928 --> 01:29:33,367
But I have returned.

1016
01:29:33,392 --> 01:29:37,035
The day of reckoning,
it is here.

1017
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:39,612
All your buildings...

1018
01:29:39,732 --> 01:29:43,897
All your buildings and temples...

1019
01:29:43,922 --> 01:29:45,649
... will fall.

1020
01:29:45,674 --> 01:29:51,244
The dawn of a new era will emerge.

1021
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:53,813
For there is nothing you can do...

1022
01:29:53,814 --> 01:29:56,115
- Jean.
- ... to stop what is coming.

1023
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,981
Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.

1024
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:02,079
Cairo.
Find us.

1025
01:30:02,104 --> 01:30:04,589
Jean, find us.
Cairo. Find us.

1026
01:30:04,614 --> 01:30:07,833
Jean.
This message is for one reason alone.

1027
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:10,634
To tell the strongest among you...

1028
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:14,332
Those with the greatest power.

1029
01:30:14,357 --> 01:30:18,025
This earth will be yours.

1030
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,014
Those with the greatest power.

1031
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:26,611
Protect those without.

1032
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:31,642
That's my message to the world.

1033
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:38,565
That was Charles doing that
without Cerebro.

1034
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:41,167
Sir, what was that voice?

1035
01:30:41,594 --> 01:30:42,785
I know that voice.

1036
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,422
It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?

1037
01:30:44,447 --> 01:30:47,078
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

1038
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:48,784
He just spoke to me.

1039
01:30:48,809 --> 01:30:51,186
- I think he spoke to everyone.
- I can hear him too.

1040
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:53,968
No, no. He just sent
me a hidden message.

1041
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:56,206
One he knew only I would hear.

1042
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:58,008
I know where they are.

1043
01:30:58,514 --> 01:30:59,814
Hey!

1044
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,664
Shots fired!
Where's it coming from?

1045
01:31:04,494 --> 01:31:06,841
I have intruders in quad 6.

1046
01:31:08,073 --> 01:31:10,553
Send a security team
and take them out.

1047
01:31:17,797 --> 01:31:20,494
The generator.
It's worth a shot.

1048
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:22,152
Kurt?

1049
01:31:43,577 --> 01:31:45,814
There's some kind of animal in there.

1050
01:31:49,209 --> 01:31:51,129
It's no animal.

1051
01:31:52,415 --> 01:31:54,024
It's a man.

1052
01:31:54,049 --> 01:31:55,672
Who is he?

1053
01:31:56,441 --> 01:31:59,397
A part of himself
has been taken away.

1054
01:31:59,634 --> 01:32:00,865
What do you mean?

1055
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,818
I mean, they turned him into...

1056
01:32:03,843 --> 01:32:05,841
... some kind of weapon.

1057
01:32:10,203 --> 01:32:13,585
Charlie 3, report.
Did you find them?

1058
01:32:24,258 --> 01:32:25,806
Turn it down.

1059
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:50,430
Fire!

1060
01:33:00,703 --> 01:33:03,243
Weapon X is loose.
I repeat.

1061
01:33:03,268 --> 01:33:05,980
Weapon X is loose.

1062
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,532
I repeat.
Weapon X is loose.

1063
01:33:07,557 --> 01:33:09,762
You sure he's not an animal?

1064
01:33:14,349 --> 01:33:17,536
- He's in the central halls.
- Engaging target, Sector 5.

1065
01:33:18,357 --> 01:33:19,987
We can't stop h... !

1066
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:36,528
Hey!

1067
01:33:56,787 --> 01:33:58,649
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

1068
01:33:58,674 --> 01:33:59,730
I just lost the feed.

1069
01:33:59,755 --> 01:34:02,135
- What's going on here?
- Hey!

1070
01:34:02,808 --> 01:34:04,551
I'll be right back.

1071
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:08,803
Move!

1072
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:26,637
Hey! 
Stay where you are!

1073
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,231
- No, wait.
- Stop!

1074
01:34:46,962 --> 01:34:48,674
Scott, wait.

1075
01:34:50,533 --> 01:34:52,849
I can help you.

1076
01:34:57,983 --> 01:34:59,483
Jean.

1077
01:35:37,849 --> 01:35:40,365
Logan.
Logan.

1078
01:36:27,813 --> 01:36:29,545
What did you do to him?

1079
01:36:30,778 --> 01:36:33,848
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

1080
01:36:34,634 --> 01:36:37,242
Just a few memories I could reach.

1081
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:41,646
I hope that's the last
we'd seen of that guy.

1082
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:01,994
Kurt.

1083
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:05,801
- What?
- What?

1084
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,183
Hey.

1085
01:37:11,727 --> 01:37:14,353
Stay away from the...

1086
01:37:14,354 --> 01:37:15,654
The what?

1087
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,073
Th... door...
Stay away from the...

1088
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:19,600
- Get away from the door!
- The door! The door!

1089
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,907
On three.
One.

1090
01:37:21,932 --> 01:37:23,232
Two.

1091
01:37:36,028 --> 01:37:37,537
We know where the Professor is.

1092
01:37:37,562 --> 01:37:39,148
I think we might have
a way out of here.

1093
01:37:39,173 --> 01:37:40,506
Well, you've been busy.

1094
01:37:40,537 --> 01:37:43,142
We had a... a little help.

1095
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:44,764
Let's go.

1096
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:48,336
- Watch out!
- Jesus!

1097
01:37:48,361 --> 01:37:49,738
Oh, sorry.

1098
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:51,304
This way.

1099
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:02,948
This was meant to be
the center of the universe

1100
01:38:02,973 --> 01:38:04,747
before I was betrayed.

1101
01:38:04,772 --> 01:38:08,681
Now.
It will be.

1102
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:30,133
Nice.

1103
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:32,780
Hey, Hank. Do you think
you can fly this thing?

1104
01:39:33,908 --> 01:39:35,933
Yeah, I can figure it out.

1105
01:39:37,127 --> 01:39:38,892
Hey, guys.

1106
01:39:39,185 --> 01:39:41,092
Flight suits.

1107
01:39:44,766 --> 01:39:46,715
You got your warplane.

1108
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,642
Let's go to war.

1109
01:39:55,514 --> 01:39:57,463
A gift...

1110
01:39:57,488 --> 01:40:00,374
From the past you left behind.

1111
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,003
And the future that lies ahead.

1112
01:40:04,647 --> 01:40:08,265
You, will reach down, my son,

1113
01:40:08,296 --> 01:40:10,570
deep into the Earth.

1114
01:40:10,595 --> 01:40:13,977
Rip everything they built
from the ground.

1115
01:40:14,002 --> 01:40:16,864
Wipe clean this world.

1116
01:40:16,889 --> 01:40:20,534
And we will lead those that survived.

1117
01:40:20,558 --> 01:40:23,699
into a better one.

1118
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:25,243
And me?

1119
01:40:26,544 --> 01:40:29,796
Am I to play a role
in this madness?

1120
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:34,514
You have the most
important role of all.

1121
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,468
Were you scared?

1122
01:40:47,907 --> 01:40:50,019
That day in DC,
were you scared?

1123
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,388
No.

1124
01:40:56,964 --> 01:40:59,324
But I was scared
on my first mission.

1125
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:02,533
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

1126
01:41:02,558 --> 01:41:04,469
About your age.

1127
01:41:07,638 --> 01:41:10,156
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1128
01:41:11,306 --> 01:41:13,280
Your brother was there.

1129
01:41:13,305 --> 01:41:15,214
We used to call Havoc.

1130
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:17,618
He was a real handful, but...

1131
01:41:19,017 --> 01:41:21,987
When it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1132
01:41:24,024 --> 01:41:26,809
What happened to the rest
of the kids that went with you?

1133
01:41:26,834 --> 01:41:28,440
The X-Men.

1134
01:41:30,812 --> 01:41:33,210
Hank and I are
the only ones left.

1135
01:41:33,728 --> 01:41:36,069
I couldn't save the rest of them.

1136
01:41:36,515 --> 01:41:38,672
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1137
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,481
Well, you're a hero to us.

1138
01:41:41,506 --> 01:41:45,476
Seeing you that day on TV
changed my life.

1139
01:41:45,501 --> 01:41:47,065
My too.

1140
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:48,671
My too.

1141
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:53,578
I mean, I still live in
my mom's basement, but...

1142
01:41:53,603 --> 01:41:55,578
Everything else is...

1143
01:41:57,539 --> 01:41:59,674
Well, it's pretty much the same.

1144
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:03,151
I'm a total loser.

1145
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,885
What we're seeing is a
magnetic phenomenon

1146
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:07,887
on a much larger scale
than we saw in Auschwitz.

1147
01:43:07,912 --> 01:43:12,287
The ground is full of magnetic elements.
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1148
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:14,764
The ocean's floor is
lying with them too.

1149
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:17,784
It's already begun,
at the lowest depths.

1150
01:43:17,809 --> 01:43:21,001
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

1151
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:23,783
Eventually, cities, urban centers.

1152
01:43:23,808 --> 01:43:27,925
Anything built since the
Bronze Age will be wiped away.

1153
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,349
The death toll will be billions.

1154
01:43:29,374 --> 01:43:32,941
He's talking about the
whole god damn world.

1155
01:43:46,826 --> 01:43:49,551
What's going on?
Everyone, move!

1156
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,509
You're just another false god.

1157
01:44:23,534 --> 01:44:26,083
And whoever's left to follow you
when this is all over.

1158
01:44:26,108 --> 01:44:29,343
They will betray you again.

1159
01:44:31,294 --> 01:44:33,534
You're wrong, Charles.

1160
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:37,146
For the first time in a thousand lifetimes...

1161
01:44:37,171 --> 01:44:39,407
I have you.

1162
01:44:39,432 --> 01:44:45,225
For all my gifts, I've yet to
possess the one I needed most.

1163
01:44:45,573 --> 01:44:49,955
To be... everywhere.

1164
01:44:52,415 --> 01:44:57,007
To be... everyone.

1165
01:45:11,434 --> 01:45:13,913
Seventh wonder, 12 o'clock.

1166
01:45:21,638 --> 01:45:24,628
He has the Professor in the
center of the pyramid.

1167
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:28,530
He's going to transfer his
consciousness into the Professor.

1168
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:33,436
If he does that, he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.

1169
01:45:39,852 --> 01:45:42,531
What the hell is that?

1170
01:45:43,146 --> 01:45:44,780
It's Erik.

1171
01:45:53,879 --> 01:45:56,834
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1172
01:45:57,926 --> 01:46:00,145
Get Charles.
I'll take care of Erik.

1173
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:02,234
How are you going to
get through that?

1174
01:46:02,961 --> 01:46:04,989
I can get you in there.

1175
01:46:05,014 --> 01:46:07,338
I came here for him.
Let me help you.

1176
01:46:07,914 --> 01:46:10,555
The rest of you, get Charles on
this plane and get him out of here.

1177
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:13,261
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

1178
01:46:13,286 --> 01:46:14,541
We'll catch up.

1179
01:46:14,566 --> 01:46:16,038
Hold on.

1180
01:46:46,051 --> 01:46:47,361
Hank, you go with the kids.

1181
01:46:47,386 --> 01:46:49,720
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

1182
01:46:50,094 --> 01:46:51,286
What?

1183
01:46:51,287 --> 01:46:54,240
Not all of us can fully
control our powers.

1184
01:46:54,265 --> 01:46:55,917
Then, don't.

1185
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:58,190
You need to embrace them.

1186
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:02,542
We all do.

1187
01:47:25,997 --> 01:47:28,910
Go, join the others.

1188
01:47:28,935 --> 01:47:32,816
Protect me until the
transference is complete.

1189
01:47:57,167 --> 01:47:59,258
There's an entrance.
It's clear.

1190
01:48:03,152 --> 01:48:05,459
Kurt.
Get in there!

1191
01:48:15,493 --> 01:48:17,421
In the pyramid.
Move!

1192
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:19,096
Go!

1193
01:48:55,408 --> 01:48:57,146
Split them up.

1194
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,751
Professor.

1195
01:49:24,964 --> 01:49:26,332
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1196
01:49:26,357 --> 01:49:29,370
I'm trying.
It's like a maze in here.

1197
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,452
Kurt, no!

1198
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:08,300
The magnetic field is too strong,
I can't get us in there.

1199
01:50:10,149 --> 01:50:11,926
Erik!

1200
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:20,171
Mystique.

1201
01:50:23,821 --> 01:50:26,582
I know you think
you've lost everything.

1202
01:50:27,568 --> 01:50:29,439
But, you haven't.

1203
01:50:30,621 --> 01:50:32,443
You have me.

1204
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:35,048
You have Charles.

1205
01:50:40,716 --> 01:50:43,448
You have more family than you know.

1206
01:50:44,451 --> 01:50:47,846
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1207
01:50:48,428 --> 01:50:50,626
But you do now.

1208
01:50:52,815 --> 01:50:55,235
That's what I've come here
to tell you.

1209
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:02,284
And you?

1210
01:51:11,194 --> 01:51:12,542
I'm your...

1211
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:19,627
I'm here for my family too.

1212
01:52:08,852 --> 01:52:10,743
Get out!
Get out!

1213
01:52:10,768 --> 01:52:12,793
GET OUT !!!

1214
01:52:18,878 --> 01:52:20,552
Arrivederci.

1215
01:52:31,862 --> 01:52:33,643
We're losing him.

1216
01:52:49,403 --> 01:52:51,147
I'll be right back.

1217
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,858
Scott, glasses on!

1218
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,540
Let's go!

1219
01:53:30,784 --> 01:53:32,918
- Lock on.
- Here we go.

1220
01:53:49,917 --> 01:53:51,535
Psylocke!

1221
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:09,368
What the hell was that?

1222
01:54:15,532 --> 01:54:16,757
Kurt.

1223
01:54:16,782 --> 01:54:18,334
Everyone grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1224
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:19,792
I've never done it
with this many people.

1225
01:54:19,817 --> 01:54:21,660
Get us out of here.

1226
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:38,492
Kurt, hurry!

1227
01:54:39,476 --> 01:54:40,815
Kurt!

1228
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,081
Charles.

1229
01:55:13,515 --> 01:55:14,672
Is he okay?

1230
01:55:14,673 --> 01:55:16,919
It's his energy.
He's drained.

1231
01:55:16,990 --> 01:55:19,473
No.
Get out.

1232
01:55:19,498 --> 01:55:21,428
Get...
Get out!

1233
01:55:21,453 --> 01:55:24,636
Professor. Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

1234
01:55:24,965 --> 01:55:26,652
It's okay.

1235
01:55:35,055 --> 01:55:37,902
I'm going to go fight
for what I have left.

1236
01:55:41,116 --> 01:55:42,799
Are you?

1237
01:55:55,774 --> 01:55:58,418
There's so much more than you
than you know.

1238
01:55:58,443 --> 01:56:01,348
Not just pain and anger.

1239
01:56:01,623 --> 01:56:03,990
There's good too.
I felt it.

1240
01:56:04,015 --> 01:56:06,120
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

1241
01:56:06,145 --> 01:56:10,274
Here you have the chance to be part
of something much bigger than yourself.

1242
01:56:10,642 --> 01:56:13,123
And it needs you, Erik.

1243
01:56:42,046 --> 01:56:44,179
Useless.

1244
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,647
Charles.

1245
01:56:52,946 --> 01:56:55,598
I know you can hear me.

1246
01:56:56,136 --> 01:56:59,996
We're still connected.

1247
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:04,574
Charles!

1248
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:07,196
Show yourself!

1249
01:57:07,348 --> 01:57:10,073
CHARLES!

1250
01:57:10,172 --> 01:57:12,855
SHOW YOURSELF!

1251
01:57:41,997 --> 01:57:44,635
Foolish child.

1252
01:57:52,678 --> 01:57:54,129
Peter.

1253
01:58:10,906 --> 01:58:12,574
End him.

1254
01:58:34,451 --> 01:58:38,029
(Greater fighter. She's my hero.
I want to be like her... )

1255
01:58:38,707 --> 01:58:40,348
Raven.

1256
01:58:47,518 --> 01:58:49,963
The great hero.

1257
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:56,438
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

1258
01:58:56,439 --> 01:58:57,939
No.

1259
01:58:58,628 --> 01:59:01,922
- It's me he wants.
- Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1260
01:59:01,947 --> 01:59:05,614
If he has you, he has us all.
The whole world.

1261
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:09,516
You are feeble.
Just like the others.

1262
01:59:09,541 --> 01:59:11,299
Charles!

1263
01:59:11,324 --> 01:59:14,731
Come!
Rescue your weakling!

1264
01:59:14,756 --> 01:59:18,105
Give your life,
for their's!

1265
01:59:18,969 --> 01:59:20,469
No.

1266
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,862
He was right.

1267
01:59:30,558 --> 01:59:33,626
There is still some part
of me connected to him.

1268
01:59:33,651 --> 01:59:34,804
Charles!

1269
01:59:34,829 --> 01:59:36,226
I can get inside his head.

1270
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:38,726
Will you do nothing?

1271
01:59:39,683 --> 01:59:42,182
Thank you for letting me in.

1272
01:59:59,550 --> 02:00:01,510
You want what I have?

1273
02:00:01,535 --> 02:00:04,100
You want to feel what I feel?

1274
02:00:15,404 --> 02:00:17,447
Welcome to my world!

1275
02:00:18,826 --> 02:00:21,087
You're in my house now!

1276
02:00:30,631 --> 02:00:33,239
You'll need a bigger house.

1277
02:01:52,095 --> 02:01:53,914
You betray me.

1278
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:55,439
No.

1279
02:01:55,756 --> 02:01:57,797
I betrayed them.

1280
02:02:25,466 --> 02:02:26,738
Let's jump.

1281
02:02:26,739 --> 02:02:28,239
What?

1282
02:02:32,957 --> 02:02:34,457
Cover me.

1283
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,950
I got you.

1284
02:02:43,102 --> 02:02:44,602
Come on!

1285
02:03:05,596 --> 02:03:08,447
They lack strength, Charles.

1286
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,836
Jean.

1287
02:03:21,181 --> 02:03:22,987
Come here.

1288
02:03:34,978 --> 02:03:36,533
Help...

1289
02:03:38,838 --> 02:03:40,207
Me.

1290
02:03:45,092 --> 02:03:46,601
Stay here.

1291
02:03:55,593 --> 02:03:57,638
They can't stop him.

1292
02:03:57,855 --> 02:03:59,554
Jean.

1293
02:04:01,446 --> 02:04:04,275
Help me.

1294
02:04:26,863 --> 02:04:28,424
Hank!

1295
02:04:29,145 --> 02:04:30,850
Hank!

1296
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:40,259
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

1297
02:04:40,284 --> 02:04:42,700
You're mine now.

1298
02:04:44,429 --> 02:04:47,485
You will never win.

1299
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:49,805
And why is that?

1300
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:51,917
Because you are alone.

1301
02:04:53,728 --> 02:04:57,769
And I am not!

1302
02:05:09,304 --> 02:05:10,929
Let...

1303
02:05:10,954 --> 02:05:12,619
go.

1304
02:05:12,644 --> 02:05:15,744
Unleash your power, Jean.

1305
02:05:16,026 --> 02:05:18,060
No fear.

1306
02:06:05,037 --> 02:06:07,929
Unleash your power!

1307
02:06:07,954 --> 02:06:10,252
Let go, Jean!

1308
02:06:10,277 --> 02:06:13,049
Jean, let go!

1309
02:06:47,774 --> 02:06:49,744
He's getting away.

1310
02:07:06,949 --> 02:07:10,750
All is revealed.

1311
02:08:12,396 --> 02:08:14,607
Charles! 
Charles!

1312
02:08:15,435 --> 02:08:16,681
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

1313
02:08:16,706 --> 02:08:18,652
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

1314
02:08:18,677 --> 02:08:20,061
Charles...

1315
02:08:20,086 --> 02:08:21,834
No, he's not.

1316
02:08:22,476 --> 02:08:24,524
I can still feel him.

1317
02:08:48,288 --> 02:08:50,154
Thank you, Jean.

1318
02:08:51,936 --> 02:08:53,436
Charles?

1319
02:08:53,896 --> 02:08:56,280
Charles, do you know where you are?

1320
02:08:58,917 --> 02:09:01,110
I'm on a beach.

1321
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,812
In Cuba.

1322
02:09:10,212 --> 02:09:12,015
With you.

1323
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,747
What beach?

1324
02:09:20,793 --> 02:09:22,577
Charles Xavier.

1325
02:09:48,848 --> 02:09:50,710
I'm sorry.

1326
02:09:50,942 --> 02:09:54,017
I should never have
taken those from you.

1327
02:09:56,748 --> 02:09:58,403
Hold on!

1328
02:10:02,817 --> 02:10:04,671
What did I miss?

1329
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,504
It seems only by the grace of God,

1330
02:10:09,529 --> 02:10:11,051
that the ominous destruction...

1331
02:10:11,076 --> 02:10:14,014
seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.

1332
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:16,901
At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert,

1333
02:10:16,926 --> 02:10:18,755
revealed to an investigative
committee...

1334
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:21,887
The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr,

1335
02:10:21,912 --> 02:10:24,495
aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown...

1336
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:26,958
I think our prayers were answered.

1337
02:10:27,426 --> 02:10:28,980
Thank you, Mr. President.

1338
02:10:29,005 --> 02:10:30,283
The potential destructive power
of mutants...

1339
02:10:30,308 --> 02:10:32,720
... is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate

1340
02:10:32,745 --> 02:10:36,971
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.

1341
02:11:03,879 --> 02:11:06,883
Mystique told me 
he is your father.

1342
02:11:07,321 --> 02:11:09,404
Are you gonna tell him?

1343
02:11:10,715 --> 02:11:12,232
I might...

1344
02:11:12,526 --> 02:11:14,086
one day.

1345
02:11:15,305 --> 02:11:18,274
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

1346
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:25,759
Me, too.

1347
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:39,728
The world's already begun
rebuilding it's arsenals.

1348
02:11:39,753 --> 02:11:42,308
It's human nature, Charles.

1349
02:11:43,963 --> 02:11:45,884
I still have hope.

1350
02:11:46,188 --> 02:11:48,026
Oh, yes.

1351
02:11:48,873 --> 02:11:50,440
"Hope."

1352
02:11:50,801 --> 02:11:52,902
I was right about Raven.

1353
02:11:53,499 --> 02:11:55,804
I was even right about you.

1354
02:11:58,611 --> 02:12:00,668
What about the rest of the world?

1355
02:12:01,503 --> 02:12:05,078
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1356
02:12:06,848 --> 02:12:10,006
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1357
02:12:10,031 --> 02:12:12,091
and your children.

1358
02:12:13,568 --> 02:12:15,541
It does, indeed

1359
02:12:15,542 --> 02:12:18,096
What do you do when
you wake up to that?

1360
02:12:19,475 --> 02:12:21,915
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

1361
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:25,309
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1362
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:33,149
You're sure I can't convince you
to stay?

1363
02:12:34,299 --> 02:12:36,467
You're psychic, Charles.

1364
02:12:36,658 --> 02:12:39,221
You can convince me to do anything.

1365
02:12:41,323 --> 02:12:43,379
Goodbye, old friend.

1366
02:12:43,978 --> 02:12:45,939
Good luck, Professor.

1367
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:53,380
Forget everything you think you know.

1368
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:57,303
Whatever lessons you learned
in school...

1369
02:12:57,532 --> 02:13:00,082
Whatever your parents taught you.

1370
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:04,905
None of that matters!

1371
02:13:05,734 --> 02:13:08,103
You're not kids anymore.

1372
02:13:08,128 --> 02:13:10,278
You're not students.

1373
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:15,961
You're X-men.
