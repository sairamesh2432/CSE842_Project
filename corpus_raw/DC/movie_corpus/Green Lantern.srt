1
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>Billions of years ago...</i>

2
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:40,078
<i>... a race of immortals harnessed</i>
<i>the most powerful force in existence:</i>

3
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:43,719
<i>The emerald energy of willpower.</i>

4
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,289
<i>These immortals,</i>
<i>the Guardians of the Universe...</i>

5
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,825
<i>... built a world from where they could</i>
<i>watch over all of existence:</i>

6
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:52,395
<i>The planet Oa.</i>

7
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,463
<i>They divided the universe</i>
<i>into 3600 sectors.</i>

8
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:03,131
<i>A ring powered by the energy of will</i>
<i>was sent to every sector to select a recruit.</i>

9
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,678
<i>In order to be chosen by the ring,</i>
<i>it was said one must be without fear.</i>

10
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,808
<i>Together, these 3600 recruits...</i>

11
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:17,945
<i>... formed the intergalactic peacekeepers</i>
<i>known as the Green Lantern Corps.</i>

12
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:29,659
<i>Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...</i>

13
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:33,999
<i>... the gravest was an entity of fear</i>
<i>known as Parallax.</i>

14
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,737
<i>Only the legendary Green Lantern</i>
<i>Abin Sur...</i>

15
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:40,241
<i>... was capable of capturing</i>
<i>and imprisoning this beast...</i>

16
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:44,178
<i>... which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.</i>

17
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,667
You are afraid.

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,774
Good.

19
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,899
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should...

20
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,544
<i>Fentara is dead.</i>

21
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:05,110
The planet's inhabitants?

22
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,717
<i>Your mission to evacuate them</i>
<i>is no longer necessary.</i>

23
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,345
<i>It's just as it was on Talok.</i>

24
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,758
<i>Every life form destroyed</i>
<i>and their essence absorbed.</i>

25
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,092
<i>Traces of yellow power everywhere.</i>

26
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,592
And the Guardians?

27
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:20,230
<i>The Guardians are silent.</i>

28
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,432
<i>I've demanded an audience with them.</i>

29
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,575
Abin Sur.

30
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm badly wounded.

31
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:31,868
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet
for the selection process.

32
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:35,803
Tell the Guardians it's Parallax.

33
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,847
No. No.

34
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,527
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?

35
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,463
There's, uh, water in the tap.

36
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,822
No!

37
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,653
Yup.

38
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,197
Asshole.

39
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:44,873
The Ferris Sabre III is state-of-the-art
of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.

40
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:48,877
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot...

41
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:52,180
...but with none of the human error
that comes with it.

42
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,347
Carl isn't just blowing smoke
to get a contract, general.

43
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,545
Your staff, these contractors, my office...

44
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:00,122
...we've all been part of this
from the ground up.

45
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,085
Well, I appreciate that, senator.

46
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,353
But today the rubber meets the road.

47
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,523
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl's two best pilots.

48
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,150
Carol. Was gonna do a little flying today.
What do you think?

49
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,548
I think you're late.

50
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,781
Yes, but that's only because I slept in.

51
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,948
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.

52
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,020
Let me give you a little heads-up.

53
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,596
I've gone up against these Sabres all week
and they smoked me every time.

54
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,166
There isn't anything you can do that
they can't do better, faster...

55
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,599
...and without disappointing women
everywhere.

56
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,171
I, uh, think we both know that's not true.

57
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,741
This is exactly why I didn't want you
for this. My father did.

58
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:54,344
I would've gone with Jensen.

59
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:58,175
I'd have too, but unfortunately
he's busy not being good enough.

60
00:08:58,349 --> 00:08:59,873
At least he shows up.

61
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,541
Hal...

62
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,687
...this test today, it's important.

63
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,688
I'm gonna make you look good up there.
Don't worry, okay?

64
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:10,453
Now let's get these pants off
and fly some planes.

65
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,361
Highball, weapon check now.

66
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,830
Roger that.

67
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,965
- Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
- Morning, everybody.

68
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:24,699
Gentlemen.

69
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:29,204
- We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.

70
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,375
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot
at the merge.

71
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,144
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.

72
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,117
Fly safe, Highball.

73
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:39,381
Um, no.

74
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:53,035
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?

75
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,904
F-35s, what else?

76
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:04,010
<i>Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.</i>

77
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:06,173
You got a shot,
now would be a great time.

78
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:09,286
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.

79
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,398
There's no way
we're taking these out solo.

80
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,834
<i>Get over here.</i>
<i>Let's figure something out.</i>

81
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,339
<i>On my way, Highball.</i>

82
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:38,014
Now stay right there and look real pretty.

83
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,706
Highball, did you just use your wingman
as a decoy?

84
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:29,833
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6
can fly anywhere you can.

85
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,901
Then let's go somewhere I can't fly.

86
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:37,898
What the hell is he up to?

87
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:39,433
Coffin corner.

88
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:44,345
Highball, rules of engagement
set ceiling at 50,000 feet.

89
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:47,780
Yeah, because the Sabres will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?

90
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,146
And so will you.

91
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,492
<i>Compressor stall. Compressor stall.</i>

92
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,562
Yes!

93
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:44,375
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.

94
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:47,175
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.

95
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,814
<i>Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.</i>

96
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:52,006
I got it.

97
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,478
<i>Hal.</i>

98
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,427
Keep it warm for me.

99
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,188
Going through 25,000.

100
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,597
Hey, you okay, Highball?

101
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:13,399
Yeah, just taking my victory lap.

102
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:23,745
- Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.

103
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,550
Yeah, Dad!

104
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:35,225
<i>Hal, do you read me?</i>

105
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:47,929
<i>Highball, you're approaching</i>
<i>minimum ejection altitude.</i>

106
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,779
<i>Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL.</i>
<i>Spin is unrecoverable.</i>

107
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,375
<i>Eject, eject, eject!</i>

108
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,544
You're not scared, are you, Dad?

109
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,553
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

110
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:11,652
Dad!

111
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,563
Dad!

112
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,149
You stupid son of a bitch. You...

113
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,381
Stand down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.

114
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:41,718
It does matter.

115
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,794
Never mind that you crashed
a brand-new F-35.

116
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,863
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.

117
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,626
And you blew the contract
this company was depending on.

118
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.

119
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,428
I was under the impression
the objective was to win.

120
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,666
No, the objective was to show
what the Sabres could do in combat.

121
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,812
And in combat,
no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.

122
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:03,637
I did.

123
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:08,211
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can't do.

124
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:11,048
You didn't have to make that point
in front of Air Force Acquisitions.

125
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,450
That's enough, Carol.

126
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:18,160
Since I'm gonna have to lay off most of
my company anyway, you're fired, Hal.

127
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,455
It's too late. I quit.

128
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,257
He's not fired and you don't quit.

129
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,060
You're grounded,
pending the results of an investigation.

130
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,243
Watch your back.

131
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:34,843
That's impossible, Bob.

132
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:44,212
- Tell me what happened.
- Controls locked up.

133
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,824
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a
window when you could've recovered.

134
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,516
Did you choke?

135
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,821
You wouldn't be the first,
but I need to know.

136
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,692
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?

137
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,356
What's with the ridiculous suit?

138
00:15:56,534 --> 00:16:00,300
- I know your dad's been bucking for you...
- The merits of my career choices...

139
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:04,669
You're a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.

140
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,173
I like it and I'm good at it.

141
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:10,041
Doesn't mean I'll never get in a cockpit
again. It isn't one way or the other.

142
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:13,650
That's the way a child looks at things,
and we aren't children anymore.

143
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:16,681
At least...

144
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,851
I just don't wanna see
someone I care about getting hurt.

145
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:26,586
Least of all you.

146
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:06,932
Choose well.

147
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:34,295
<i>A test pilot's daring maneuvers</i>
<i>almost ended in tragedy.</i>

148
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:38,925
<i>Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan</i>
<i>ejected at the last possible second...</i>

149
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,162
<i>... before his jet crashed</i>
<i>in the open desert.</i>

150
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:43,273
<i>He's the son of the late Martin Jordan...</i>

151
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:46,467
<i>... who was killed in his own</i>
<i>ill-fated test flight back in 1993.</i>

152
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:49,169
<i>We are told that Hal Jordan</i>
<i>is doing fine right now...</i>

153
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:52,214
<i>... though we have yet to hear</i>
<i>an official statement.</i>

154
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Hey, guys.

155
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:57,145
<i>The incident has been a blow</i>
<i>to a new high-tech aircraft program...</i>

156
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,754
Hey. How was work?

157
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:01,483
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.

158
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,787
Just help me out here, because
I'm really trying to understand this.

159
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,827
- Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be like him so bad?

160
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,262
- You just assume it's my fault.
- I talked to Carl.

161
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,526
- Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its limits...

162
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,500
That's my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.

163
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:18,073
Like your motorcycle accident
that put you in the hospital for a month?

164
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:21,038
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.

165
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:24,579
- God.
- Jack, come on.

166
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,410
You okay?

167
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:28,642
Where's Jason?

168
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,119
In his room.

169
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:32,812
Why?

170
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,157
Hey, it's Uncle Hal.

171
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:39,420
What's up there, ace?

172
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:43,328
This is the worst 11th birthday party
I've ever been to.

173
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,935
No dancing girls?
What's going on...? Hey.

174
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,429
Hey.

175
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,868
I'm fine.

176
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,442
I guess I got a little freaked out
or something.

177
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,476
It happens.

178
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,704
Not to you.

179
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,638
Look...

180
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,508
...you don't have anything
to worry about.

181
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:02,710
You wanna know why?

182
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:06,715
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up
in every other part of my life...

183
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:10,918
...but the one thing I do know
how to do is fly.

184
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:17,500
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.

185
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,871
Cool. It's an X-1, right?

186
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:28,102
It's a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.

187
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,940
Let's put it up.

188
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,810
What happened today?

189
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,611
I mean, when you crashed.

190
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,720
Not really sure, exactly.

191
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,119
Were you scared?

192
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:44,989
It's my job not to be.

193
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:50,499
You know, you're totally missing
your super-lame birthday party.

194
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:54,229
Beat it. Go, go, go!

195
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,668
I'm glad you're okay.

196
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,904
Me too, ace.

197
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,422
Get off! No!

198
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,992
Aah! No!

199
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:28,595
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you some help.

200
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,258
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.

201
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,700
Your name. Your name.

202
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:37,534
It's Hal. Hal Jordan.

203
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,645
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814.

204
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,041
Okay, hey, listen.

205
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:49,676
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.

206
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,246
The ring...

207
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:53,947
...it chose you.

208
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,616
Take it!

209
00:21:56,126 --> 00:22:00,028
Place the ring in the lantern.

210
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,757
Place the ring, speak the oath...

211
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,395
- What?
- Great honor, responsibility...

212
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,163
I don't understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?

213
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,807
All you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

214
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,443
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

215
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,445
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don't do that.

216
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:21,406
Hey, now, don't do that.

217
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,287
Oh, come on.

218
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,999
<i>X-97 systems check complete.</i>

219
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,642
Yo.

220
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,237
Come again?

221
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:09,357
Hmm.

222
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:11,460
Is that a spaceship?

223
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:13,199
Yeah.

224
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,836
Is it real?

225
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,203
It's real.

226
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:21,200
Did you see what kind of power source
this thing uses?

227
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:23,141
- Do you understand...?
- We can't stay.

228
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,576
- We can't stay here.
- What?

229
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,613
- Gotta go.
- What?

230
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:28,342
Pilot.

231
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,620
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.

232
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,620
He gave me this.

233
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,315
He proposed?

234
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,130
We're gone. We're gone, now!

235
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:02,141
They're gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don't bury themselves.

236
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,911
I couldn't just leave him there.

237
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:06,685
I hope this thing isn't radioactive.

238
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,885
- Yeah, well, you're the genius.
You... Aah! - Aah!

239
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,721
- Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!

240
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,330
Got it!

241
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:21,032
He said that the ring chose me.

242
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:24,572
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.

243
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,066
Responsibility?

244
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,267
- Yeah.
- You?

245
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,607
Well, maybe on their planet
"responsibility" just means "asshole."

246
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,043
Let's hope so.

247
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,094
A great light has gone out
in the universe.

248
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,694
Abin Sur is dead.

249
00:24:56,907 --> 00:25:00,365
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.

250
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:04,978
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.

251
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:08,243
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.

252
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,181
We know it originated from
within the Lost Sector.

253
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,761
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.

254
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:25,168
According to Abin Sur's last transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.

255
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:29,233
His only words were, "It's Parallax."

256
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:39,781
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.

257
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:44,612
While you assess,
innocent lives will be lost.

258
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:46,685
Let me take the fight to this enemy.

259
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:50,349
There is much of which
you are not aware, Sinestro.

260
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:53,257
If the danger is as great as we suspect...

261
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,193
What are you saying?

262
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,627
You believe this enemy can defeat us?

263
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:12,045
Guardians, if your faith in our power
has faltered, let me renew it.

264
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:15,816
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...

265
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:19,945
...and I'll prove to you
our best days are not behind us.

266
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:02,122
Dr. Hammond?

267
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,733
Dr. Hector Hammond?

268
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,897
We need to ask you to come with us.

269
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:12,868
Did Adam put you up to this?

270
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:30,425
Get out of the car, please.

271
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:01,823
Whoa.

272
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,468
Dr. Hammond?

273
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:20,069
Dr. Amanda Waller.

274
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:24,943
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the government does like its protocols.

275
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,912
Please, follow me.

276
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,067
Is that what I think it is?

277
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,869
An alien life form, doctor.

278
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,476
The first that mankind
has ever encountered...

279
00:28:56,647 --> 00:29:00,083
...despite what the conspiracy theorists
would have you believe.

280
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,947
We want you to do the initial assessment
of its physiology.

281
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,986
My God.

282
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,321
Why me?

283
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:13,952
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.

284
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,189
Beyond that...

285
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:17,128
...l'm not at liberty to tell you.

286
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,161
Hello.

287
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:57,771
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.

288
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:02,207
In the left anterior thoracic region
is a 10-centimeter wound...

289
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:06,008
...with jagged edges containing attached
cyanotic-colored coagulum.

290
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,908
Okay, all right.

291
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,747
Place the ring, then speak the oath.

292
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:14,947
The oath.

293
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:17,455
Because everybody knows the oath.

294
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,295
Used to sing it in camp.

295
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:26,963
I, Hal Jordan...

296
00:30:27,504 --> 00:30:29,734
...do solemnly swear...

297
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:32,773
...to pledge allegiance...

298
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,709
...to a lantern...

299
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:38,712
...that I got from a dying purple alien...

300
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,874
...in a swamp.

301
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,951
The epidermis is magenta.

302
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,021
It appears transparent
and is extremely thin...

303
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:51,422
...allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.

304
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:55,593
"To infinity and beyond."

305
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:58,457
"By the power of Grayskull."

306
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,125
What the hell?!

307
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:04,000
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle
of nowhere, you'd think that you...

308
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,141
No!

309
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:22,088
In brightest day, in blackest night...

310
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:25,395
...no evil shall escape my sight.

311
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,031
Let those who worship evil's might...

312
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,996
...beware my power:

313
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:38,201
Green Lantern's light.

314
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,225
Carol.

315
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,458
- Everything okay in there?
- It's fine.

316
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,291
Well, can I come in?

317
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:05,560
No.

318
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:08,295
Yeah, no, because we're...
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?

319
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,501
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

320
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,309
We can talk and drink.

321
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,287
- My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.

322
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:32,019
I don't need to tell you that the mere fact
that it's humanoid is extraordinary.

323
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:37,189
It's indicating a convergent evolution,
or perhaps a common ancestry...

324
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:40,734
...and the implications of that
are staggering.

325
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,498
I mean, where did it come from?

326
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:46,904
This could completely change the way
that the world views itself.

327
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:50,171
You imagine the way that the public
will react to this?

328
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:54,008
Um, but I know that
that won't happen. I do.

329
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:57,176
Like yourself, doctor,
I'm a seeker of truth.

330
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,879
But the people who pay for facilities
like this...

331
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,786
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.

332
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,790
So I keep it a secret.

333
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:07,623
People like us have to work
within the system, doctor.

334
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:10,391
We do the best we can.

335
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:13,798
Right.

336
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:18,167
Pick that up.

337
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:22,471
I, um...

338
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,542
I'm really sorry.

339
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:27,340
Did you just apologize?

340
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,216
You haven't been replaced by an alien
or something?

341
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,048
No.

342
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:34,715
I'm good.

343
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,449
Ah. I'm good.

344
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:40,489
I'm good, totally good. Uh...

345
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,130
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

346
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:52,431
No need to answer. That's fine.

347
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,867
Hal. Ha, ha.

348
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,278
You look pretty.

349
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:08,017
And we haven't been in this place
together since...

350
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,117
...that night.

351
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,857
- You forgot it was my birthday.
- Did I?

352
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,327
Mm.

353
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:19,161
That was also the night...
The first time that we ever...

354
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,297
...flew together.

355
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,272
You've been flying ever since
with anyone who'd get in the plane.

356
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,877
Oh, yeah.

357
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,719
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

358
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,355
- No, yeah, let's go.
- Mm-mm.

359
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:43,048
- Dance with me.
- No.

360
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:47,757
No.

361
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,631
No.

362
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:53,702
Hal. No.

363
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:58,331
No.

364
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,712
I really am sorry.

365
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:09,784
Oh. It's okay.
The contract isn't quite dead yet.

366
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:11,352
I told you I was good at this.

367
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:14,046
I wasn't talking about the contract.

368
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,660
I would've screwed this up. You know?

369
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:24,865
Even if I didn't go to the Air Force...

370
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,201
...I would've found some way to...

371
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,003
- You and me, I would've blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?

372
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:34,370
Mm. What do you tell yourself?

373
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,710
That you were scared
I was getting too close.

374
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,848
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?

375
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:48,490
What?

376
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,816
Worrying about you.

377
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:57,230
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.

378
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,901
- What happened up there?
- Thanks for the dance.

379
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,460
I told you to watch your back.

380
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:34,927
You cost us all our jobs,
you son of a bitch.

381
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:55,847
Pathetic.

382
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:59,819
Bastard's been living off his old man's
reputation his whole life.

383
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:07,369
Hey.

384
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,761
Hey!

385
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,940
My face is just getting warmed up.

386
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:04,206
Whoa.

387
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:24,192
Have you concluded admiring yourself?

388
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,850
Uh...

389
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,189
Yeah.

390
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:31,163
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.

391
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:34,530
Your mask will appear when protection
of your identity is required.

392
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,399
There is no need for it on Oa.

393
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,466
A talking fish.

394
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,302
Actually, my race is Xudarian.

395
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:43,968
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ichthyological species.

396
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:48,375
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813
and home to...

397
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:53,045
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.

398
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:55,015
How do I know that?

399
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,818
The induction process.

400
00:41:56,993 --> 00:42:01,430
It activates the ring's higher functions,
including a working knowledge base.

401
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:02,825
In truth, we were curious.

402
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:07,493
The process had never been attempted on
a species as young as humans before.

403
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:14,633
As you are the first to be chosen,
I've been sent to welcome you here.

404
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:18,379
And here is?

405
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:24,415
Welcome to Oa.

406
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,318
This planet has been our home
for countless millennia.

407
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:35,521
It was created for us by the Guardians.

408
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:37,359
Guardians?

409
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:39,296
There stands their Citadel.

410
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:43,099
They are immortals,
among the most ancient of races.

411
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:47,504
They made all you see
and are responsible for all we are and do.

412
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,677
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corps...

413
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:55,682
...has served as the keepers of peace,
order and justice throughout the universe.

414
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,953
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

415
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:02,455
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

416
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,116
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.

417
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,125
We're going to fly now.

418
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,492
- Fly?
- Absolutely.

419
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:14,296
All right.

420
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:17,029
I can do that.

421
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:23,511
Join me.

422
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:27,046
I can do that.

423
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:40,823
Yeah!

424
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:42,896
Whoa!

425
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,132
Whoa!

426
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:17,665
What is that?

427
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,734
It's the energy
that's generated from the Central Battery.

428
00:44:20,903 --> 00:44:24,395
Its power comes from the will
of every living creature in the universe.

429
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,777
It, in turn, charges your lantern,
which, in turn, charges your ring.

430
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:33,382
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.

431
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:35,113
What's with all the green?

432
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:36,751
Green is the color of will.

433
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:38,477
The Guardians harnessed will...

434
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:41,919
...because it's the strongest
source of energy in the universe.

435
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:47,823
There's so many.

436
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:51,592
The stars you can see from
your home planet on the clearest night...

437
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:53,826
...your sector is a thousand times larger.

438
00:44:55,204 --> 00:45:00,107
And 3600 Lanterns,
each with a sector just as vast.

439
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,467
Lanterns, I've called you here
to this unprecedented gathering...

440
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:30,936
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.

441
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:36,944
Our four Lantern brothers
were killed by an enemy called Parallax.

442
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:41,550
An enemy we don't yet fully understand.

443
00:45:41,984 --> 00:45:46,648
We do know it's powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.

444
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:51,983
Powerful enough
to defeat even Abin Sur...

445
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,588
...our finest warrior...

446
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:58,159
...whose light can never be replaced.

447
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:06,973
The Guardians have charged me
to lead a squadron of Lanterns...

448
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:08,872
...in an assault on Parallax.

449
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:12,776
We will seek out and find this enemy.

450
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:16,413
And we will destroy it.

451
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:20,886
Alone, we are now vulnerable.

452
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:24,649
United, we are still invincible.

453
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:27,225
We have never been defeated.

454
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:29,528
Will we be defeated now?

455
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:30,859
No!

456
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:36,362
It was for this moment
that we were created.

457
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,667
But I don't need to tell you your duty.

458
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:42,834
I don't need to tell you who we are.

459
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:50,249
<i>We are the Corps! We are the Corps!</i>

460
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:55,556
<i>We are the Corps! We are the Corps!</i>

461
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:02,786
Your will turns thought into reality.

462
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:05,961
To master the ring,
you must learn to focus your will...

463
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:09,161
...and create what you see in your mind.

464
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:15,035
The ring's limits
are only what you can imagine.

465
00:47:20,383 --> 00:47:21,714
Do that again.

466
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,146
Now you try.

467
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:26,548
Concentrate.

468
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:46,135
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.

469
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:52,411
This particular threat's name is Kilowog.

470
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:55,072
He'll be your combat training officer.

471
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:58,979
- Whoa!
- Never let your guard down, <i>poozer</i>.

472
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:02,016
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.

473
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:03,749
Or as I like to call it:

474
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,793
The worst day of your worthless life.

475
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:12,300
The human. Ain't never seen one before.

476
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:16,838
- You smell funny.
- Ugh.

477
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:18,397
I smell funny?

478
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:22,340
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.

479
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:26,138
You want to be a Lantern?
You gotta commit to the Corps.

480
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:31,286
All right, <i>poozer</i>.
Let's see what you've got.

481
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:48,025
Your constructs are only gonna be
as strong as your will.

482
00:48:48,204 --> 00:48:49,728
And your will is pathetic.

483
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:56,772
I'm gonna work you
and I'm gonna hit you...

484
00:48:56,946 --> 00:49:00,382
...until your will is strong enough
to be worthy of the Corps.

485
00:49:13,395 --> 00:49:14,760
Next lesson.

486
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:19,893
Ha, ha. Feel that?

487
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:22,697
It's the gravitational pull
of your average sun.

488
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:26,330
Makes flying through space
very dangerous.

489
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:29,672
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.

490
00:49:32,214 --> 00:49:34,239
Gravity's a bitch.

491
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,214
Here, let me help you.

492
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:46,793
Remember, your enemy,
he's not gonna play fair.

493
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:56,238
Well, that's good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.

494
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:57,872
So...

495
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:01,205
...this is the human.

496
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:04,445
When I learned Abin Sur's ring
had chosen you...

497
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:06,137
...I said there had to be a mistake.

498
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:11,252
I see nothing to change my mind.

499
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:13,582
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.

500
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:17,953
The Corps is only as strong
as its weakest link.

501
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:21,221
And I will tolerate no weak links.

502
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,095
You understand me?

503
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:27,596
Are you afraid, human?

504
00:50:30,339 --> 00:50:31,567
Are you afraid?

505
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,764
Don't.

506
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,605
Don't do that.

507
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,347
Shall we?

508
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:46,485
Sure.

509
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:49,251
A sword?

510
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:51,256
How human.

511
00:51:01,337 --> 00:51:03,897
I do believe I smell fear.

512
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:11,045
I'm a Green Lantern.

513
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,106
I fear nothing.

514
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:19,278
Fear is the enemy of will.

515
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,286
Will is what makes you take action.

516
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:28,456
Fear is what stops you
and makes you weak.

517
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,294
Makes your constructs feeble.

518
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:49,642
You must ignore your fear.
When you're afraid, you can't act.

519
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:53,345
When you can't act, you can't defend.
If you can't defend, you die.

520
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:00,418
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.

521
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,657
Abin Sur was a great warrior.

522
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:04,895
My mentor.

523
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,792
My friend.

524
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:11,465
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.

525
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:32,887
I'm done. He's right. I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend the universe.

526
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:36,122
A few days ago, we thought we were
the only ones in the universe.

527
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:39,961
The ring chose you. It wouldn't have
if it hadn't seen something in you.

528
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:41,159
Oh, yeah?

529
00:52:41,336 --> 00:52:43,531
Something you yourself don't yet see.

530
00:52:43,706 --> 00:52:45,640
The ring never makes a mistake.

531
00:52:46,742 --> 00:52:48,300
This time it did.

532
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,790
...that until recently,
we didn't realize...

533
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:42,612
...that many of these little critters
that we've been calling bacteria

534
00:53:42,613 --> 00:53:43,830
weren't bacteria at all.

535
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:48,868
They were an entirely different type
of primitive prokaryotic cell.

536
00:53:49,037 --> 00:53:52,973
These little buggers, called archaeans,
are still poorly understood.

537
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:56,904
Um...

538
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:00,105
But might turn out to be
different from bacteria...

539
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:07,650
But might turn out to be as different
from bacteria as bacteria is from us.

540
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:09,017
Some call them extremophiles...

541
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:13,984
...because they live in the most extreme
environments on Earth, such as...

542
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:16,290
<i>God, he's so boring.</i>

543
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,126
...the boiling waters of a geyser.

544
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,733
<i>What a loser.</i>

545
00:54:20,736 --> 00:54:22,499
- Michael!
- Huh?

546
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:24,496
What did you say?

547
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:26,568
I didn't say anything.

548
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:31,303
Did you just call me a loser?

549
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,573
<i>What kind of freak is this guy?</i>

550
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:35,341
"Freak"?!

551
00:54:53,936 --> 00:54:55,597
Class dismissed.

552
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,811
So how you been?

553
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:41,978
Been a while.

554
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:46,278
So you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?

555
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:51,849
You need to get some sleep, son.

556
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:55,386
- Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?

557
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:57,998
Well, actually, you've already done it.

558
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,330
For me and for your country.

559
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,326
What are you talking about?

560
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:07,669
I'm talking about you impressing
a whole lot of very important people.

561
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,605
Where did you get that?

562
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,307
I'm on a subcommittee
overseeing the agencies involved.

563
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:20,478
- Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That's why they chose me.

564
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:24,758
Because of this, we're gonna be able
to get you a top post on the inside now...

565
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:26,588
...helping to oversee the operation.

566
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:31,358
There are scientists
that worked their whole lives for this.

567
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,501
- Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.

568
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:34,966
And less connected.

569
00:56:35,137 --> 00:56:38,766
Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.

570
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:42,441
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.

571
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,977
<i>He'll never get it.</i>

572
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:48,207
<i>Just wasting his life away.</i>

573
00:56:49,584 --> 00:56:51,051
<i>What an embarrassment.</i>

574
00:56:52,854 --> 00:56:56,187
Bill! Ha. How are you?

575
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:58,019
I'm terrific.

576
00:56:58,193 --> 00:57:02,129
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.

577
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:05,644
<i>With my own eyes I saw this creature
induce fear in our finest warriors...</i>

578
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:07,944
...and then feed on that fear.

579
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,153
There's more.

580
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:14,314
We've tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.

581
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:17,158
Never before has an enemy
dared attack us here.

582
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:19,592
You must tell me what you know.

583
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:24,500
Will has always been our sole weapon...

584
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:27,365
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.

585
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:31,433
But as that power began to seem
insufficient...

586
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,077
...a great debate arose among us.

587
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:36,679
Should we exploit
another source of power...

588
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:41,008
...one we had long since sworn
should never be used?

589
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,109
Fear.

590
00:58:43,288 --> 00:58:46,917
But the power of fear
was too unpredictable.

591
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:49,753
The chance of corruption too great.

592
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:52,361
And so we decided against it.

593
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,523
<i>All of us, that is, except one.</i>

594
00:58:57,235 --> 00:59:01,001
<i>Alone, this Guardian</i>
<i>entered the forbidden chamber.</i>

595
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:05,131
<i>He wanted to prove the light of fear</i>
<i>could be mastered.</i>

596
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,143
<i>His intentions were pure...</i>

597
00:59:08,313 --> 00:59:11,373
<i>... but his hopes were naive.</i>

598
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,083
<i>Consumed by the yellow power of fear...</i>

599
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:19,815
<i>... the Guardian became the very evil</i>
<i>he had wished to destroy.</i>

600
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:22,050
<i>He became Parallax.</i>

601
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,568
For the universe's safety and his own...

602
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:36,969
...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

603
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,540
But he escaped.

604
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,646
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew larger, more powerful.

605
00:59:42,814 --> 00:59:44,008
And is now headed here...

606
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:47,481
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.

607
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,520
Then we have no choice.

608
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:00,927
We must prepare to harness the power
of our enemy and fight fear with fear.

609
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,262
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.

610
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,234
We must forge a yellow ring.

611
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:18,038
Watch your step.

612
01:00:18,216 --> 01:00:19,843
- Senator.
- Senator.

613
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:22,952
<i>Don't have to worry about me no more</i>

614
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:26,318
<i>I'm gone</i>

615
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:31,118
<i>I'm gone, I'm gone</i>

616
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:34,722
Hello.

617
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:36,127
Hi.

618
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,666
<i>Everybody get on your feet</i>

619
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,139
<i>You make me nervous</i>
<i>When you're in your seat</i>

620
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,802
Rough night, huh?

621
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,477
Hector.

622
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:55,416
How you doing?
What have you been up to?

623
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:58,180
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.

624
01:00:58,356 --> 01:01:03,225
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I've ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.

625
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,554
I've been called both.

626
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:06,125
Glad you could make it, son.

627
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,221
I was a little surprised I got the invite.

628
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:09,559
No, you're family, Hal.

629
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:12,464
There are thinkers in this world
and there are doers.

630
01:01:12,637 --> 01:01:14,400
And you are one of the doers.

631
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:18,698
Yeah, but the thinkers
make what I do possible.

632
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,242
Wouldn't have a plane
unless someone thought it up.

633
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:22,811
Of course.

634
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:24,948
Excuse me, I need a drink.

635
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:29,450
- I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.

636
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,282
- Nice to see you, son.
- You too. You too.

637
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,727
Nice.

638
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,500
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.

639
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:49,201
I was talking about your dress.

640
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,406
Nice jacket.

641
01:01:53,578 --> 01:01:55,739
Last time I checked,
you didn't even own one.

642
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,609
Yeah, I've been shaking up
the wardrobe lately.

643
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:02,310
Congratulations on the contract.
How'd you manage to pull that off?

644
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:05,820
I pointed out you only won because you
broke the rules of engagement.

645
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:09,151
And Tom figured out
how to give the Sabres more altitude.

646
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:12,592
So I guess in a way,
without even meaning to...

647
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:14,458
...you actually did us a favor.

648
01:02:16,267 --> 01:02:17,666
Look...

649
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,862
...l'm uncomfortable
with the word "hero."

650
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:22,630
<i>Hey</i>

651
01:02:29,547 --> 01:02:31,845
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.

652
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,176
Great evening.

653
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:37,583
Somebody very special I'd like to thank
for helping us to nail this contract:

654
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:40,655
My daughter, Carol Ferris.

655
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:41,849
Come on!

656
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,399
Congratulations, Carol.

657
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:55,630
I take one look at you, young lady...

658
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:58,206
...or at Hal Jordan over there,
spitting image of his dad...

659
01:02:58,376 --> 01:03:00,344
- Whoo!
- You give us hope.

660
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,541
A toast to our future.

661
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:04,510
- Hear, hear!
- To the future!

662
01:03:04,682 --> 01:03:05,774
We're in good hands.

663
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:25,064
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!

664
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:32,866
- Congratulations. Um...
- Thank you.

665
01:03:33,044 --> 01:03:36,639
Here's to you and Hal, the future.

666
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:40,680
Yeah, heh, I'm sorry.

667
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:44,815
I know it couldn't have been easy
growing up with your dad.

668
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,981
But, hey, you're doing great, so... Ha, ha.

669
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,922
I am. I'm doing great. Ha, ha.

670
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:52,756
- He's right, though. I'm not a doer.
- Ha, ha.

671
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,592
Although I did get to examine
an alien body recently.

672
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:57,290
That was very cool.

673
01:03:57,468 --> 01:04:01,029
I can't tell anyone about it,
but, hey, you can't have everything.

674
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:03,469
Hector telling you another
of his science-fiction stories?

675
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:05,632
<i>What the hell's wrong with him?</i>

676
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,573
<i>Can't keep his mouth shut.</i>

677
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,579
You really do have
a creative imagination.

678
01:04:10,748 --> 01:04:12,079
Bye.

679
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:13,407
Senator.

680
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,613
I apologize. We really must go.

681
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:19,681
- Good night, Carol.
- Good night.

682
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:24,418
Senator!

683
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:26,162
Hey.

684
01:04:26,998 --> 01:04:28,090
Thanks for everything.

685
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,406
Bye, senator!

686
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,671
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter's going down.

687
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,076
Oh, my God.

688
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:31,654
What is that? What is that?

689
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:58,131
<i>What happened tonight took place</i>
<i>in just a matter of seconds...</i>

690
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:01,005
<i>... but people will be talking about it</i>
<i>for years to come.</i>

691
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:05,080
<i>A helicopter careening out of control,</i>
<i>headed toward certain tragedy...</i>

692
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:09,413
<i>... when all of a sudden, a mystery man,</i>
<i>a hero, saves the day...</i>

693
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:13,182
<i>... incredibly diverting the helicopter</i>
<i>from destroying innocent people...</i>

694
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:17,690
<i>... and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.</i>

695
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:23,327
<i>The real question tonight is who is this</i>
<i>amazing hero and where is he now?</i>

696
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:35,736
Start talking.

697
01:08:36,914 --> 01:08:38,381
- A racetrack?
- Yeah.

698
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:39,948
Hmm.

699
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,553
That's the best you could come up with
for your first big appearance? Racetrack.

700
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:45,882
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?

701
01:08:46,056 --> 01:08:50,652
I materialized a track out of pure energy,
saving hundreds, and you're disappointed.

702
01:08:50,828 --> 01:08:51,954
I'm sorry about that.

703
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,824
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.

704
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:55,556
I don't think that's a good idea.

705
01:08:55,733 --> 01:08:57,257
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.

706
01:08:57,434 --> 01:09:00,062
I wanna see the outfit, the flying...
You gotta show me.

707
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:02,102
Hal, being your best friend's no picnic.

708
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:04,503
- It's for emergencies!
- You owe me!

709
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:07,971
Hal, I wanna see it.

710
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:10,203
Fine.

711
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,015
Hold on to your glasses.

712
01:09:15,753 --> 01:09:16,981
All right.

713
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,644
Question:

714
01:09:19,757 --> 01:09:22,487
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.

715
01:09:23,427 --> 01:09:24,621
Ring.

716
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:26,353
Finger.

717
01:09:36,874 --> 01:09:38,034
Here we go.

718
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:48,813
- Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...

719
01:09:48,986 --> 01:09:51,716
It's out of juice. I have to recharge it.

720
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:03,830
Now pay attention.

721
01:10:07,104 --> 01:10:08,799
Aah! Green!

722
01:10:11,442 --> 01:10:13,933
- Wow.
- I know, right?!

723
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,304
Whoo!

724
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:22,578
Not bad, huh?

725
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:24,914
You're a superhero.

726
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,130
Don't they always get the girl?

727
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:05,755
Evening, ma'am.

728
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:09,058
Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

729
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,395
Are you okay?

730
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:15,026
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm glad to have a chance to thank you.

731
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,935
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.

732
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,206
No, it is.

733
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,809
You saved my life.

734
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:26,341
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...

735
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:34,784
Hal?

736
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:36,351
Miss?

737
01:11:36,527 --> 01:11:37,960
Hal?!

738
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:41,391
Oh, my Go... Oh, my God!

739
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,226
- Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?

740
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,131
What? I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!

741
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,239
You don't think I would recognize you
because I can't see your cheekbones?!

742
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:54,138
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?

743
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,006
What the hell is with that mask?!

744
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:57,739
It came with the outfit.

745
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,346
Cool, huh?

746
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:05,917
So it all works
because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.

747
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,752
No, there's no such thing as magic.

748
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:11,520
Intergalactic green peacekeepers,
thousands of them.

749
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,993
- Ha, ha.
- But, no.

750
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:15,356
I'm not making it up.

751
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,369
I mean, when we were kids,
who'd have thought?

752
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,496
- I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

753
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:28,702
I said, "One day I'll be
a green space cop." Here I am.

754
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,950
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?

755
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:38,018
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.

756
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:39,747
Anything?

757
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:42,019
Anything.

758
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:00,369
Happy birthday. Better late than never.

759
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,636
Um...

760
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:05,308
Okay, so how does it work?

761
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:10,749
They just, um, call you on your cell,
"Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way"?

762
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:13,981
No. I don't think it works
exactly like that.

763
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,718
Well, technically speaking, um...

764
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,121
...I actually sort of, uh...

765
01:13:20,197 --> 01:13:21,425
...quit.

766
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:22,826
What do you mean? How?

767
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,492
Well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting
anything else, really.

768
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:28,332
I don't understand.

769
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:30,769
How do you walk away
from something like that?

770
01:13:30,941 --> 01:13:32,135
Is that even possible?

771
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:35,767
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.

772
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:44,175
If for once you didn't quit something
you cared about...

773
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:46,584
...what's the worst that could happen?

774
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:06,204
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.

775
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:09,743
- I know I've made a lot of mistakes...
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.

776
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:12,842
I feel bad for you, really.

777
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:16,016
You've been given so much so often.

778
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,354
And you just...

779
01:14:22,693 --> 01:14:24,320
Good night.

780
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:17,837
Dr. Hammond?

781
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,050
There is something I'd like to show you.

782
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,656
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll want to see.

783
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,228
<i>See you later, Mom.</i>

784
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,061
<i>- I love you.</i>
<i>- Bye, baby.</i>

785
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:41,701
<i>No!</i>

786
01:15:44,775 --> 01:15:49,144
Physical contact
accesses mnemonic data.

787
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,544
I can see your memories.

788
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:29,976
Dad.

789
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:33,987
Son, this is my fault.

790
01:16:34,825 --> 01:16:36,588
But I'm gonna fix it.

791
01:16:37,494 --> 01:16:40,952
We're gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.

792
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,530
I don't know what you're talking about.

793
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:48,102
We detected traces
of a second alien life form...

794
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,364
...buried within the body of the first.

795
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,872
You've been exposed.

796
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:58,147
I've never felt better in my life.

797
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:01,281
We know everything, son.

798
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,384
I've never felt better in my life.

799
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:28,474
<i>To be chosen to join its ranks</i>
<i>is the highest of honors...</i>

800
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,170
<i>... and the greatest of responsibilities.</i>

801
01:17:31,415 --> 01:17:33,883
<i>The ring never makes a mistake.</i>

802
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:00,569
It's gonna be all right.

803
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:03,178
They just need to run some tests,
that's all.

804
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:10,008
Keep him under.

805
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:15,383
I only want what's best for you.

806
01:18:34,144 --> 01:18:35,372
Run.

807
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:12,278
- Hector.
- Shh, shh.

808
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,973
Don't worry.

809
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:17,810
I only want what's best for you.

810
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:42,494
The ring, it chose you.

811
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,196
Take it!

812
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,340
Hal.

813
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:50,008
Hi.

814
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,749
The alien was one of you.

815
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,281
How did we end up so different?

816
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:02,186
Hmm? Hmm?

817
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:03,986
Sit down!

818
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,524
Now...

819
01:21:09,733 --> 01:21:10,961
...how's Carol?

820
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:14,570
- That came out wrong.
- Please.

821
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:16,603
- I've made mistakes...
- Look, Hal...

822
01:21:16,773 --> 01:21:19,241
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.

823
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:29,347
You're just as much of a failure
as I was.

824
01:21:30,654 --> 01:21:32,281
And just as afraid.

825
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:35,923
Well...

826
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,890
...I used to fight my fear.

827
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:46,796
But now that I've tasted its true power...

828
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:52,466
...l'll never go back.

829
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:02,952
No!

830
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,268
You wear the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.

831
01:22:27,177 --> 01:22:29,645
<i>You will suffer the same fate.</i>

832
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:33,146
Once I have devoured your world...

833
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:35,648
<i>... I will have all the strength I need...</i>

834
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:39,687
...to defeat the Corps
and destroy the Guardians.

835
01:23:12,055 --> 01:23:13,386
Let me get this straight.

836
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:16,957
This thing that's out there attacking
planets is connected to Hector?

837
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:19,687
Somehow it infected him
after it killed Abin Sur.

838
01:23:19,863 --> 01:23:24,095
- Well, you're just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it, huh?

839
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:25,928
Well, I tried that and I failed.

840
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:29,401
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.

841
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:32,234
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?

842
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:37,368
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.

843
01:23:37,914 --> 01:23:41,042
Fearless is the job description.

844
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:42,708
That isn't me.

845
01:23:42,886 --> 01:23:45,252
So you're just gonna walk away again?

846
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:49,357
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.

847
01:23:49,526 --> 01:23:51,289
Because I'm afraid!

848
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:10,136
You don't think your dad ever felt afraid?

849
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:13,245
If he did,
he figured out some way to beat it.

850
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,146
Yeah, well, there's a word for that:

851
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:18,010
Courage.

852
01:24:24,928 --> 01:24:28,625
They said that the ring wouldn't have
chosen me if it didn't see something.

853
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:32,931
Something I don't see. Yet.

854
01:24:36,673 --> 01:24:38,038
I see it.

855
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,343
I always have.

856
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,679
The ring didn't see
that you were fearless.

857
01:24:44,848 --> 01:24:48,147
It saw that you had the ability to
overcome fear.

858
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:51,318
It saw that you're courageous.

859
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,821
Which you are.

860
01:24:56,693 --> 01:24:57,990
Just like your dad.

861
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:09,399
<i>The Lantern is a threat.</i>

862
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,571
<i>Eliminate him.</i>

863
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:48,669
Our new weapon is ready.

864
01:25:49,379 --> 01:25:51,074
Once I've mastered its power...

865
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:54,376
...l'll begin training the Corps
to do the same.

866
01:25:55,752 --> 01:25:57,879
Though Earth will be lost...

867
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:02,382
...we'll be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.

868
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,150
Then the power of the enemy
will be ours.

869
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,158
At what cost?

870
01:26:08,932 --> 01:26:11,594
- You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.

871
01:26:13,202 --> 01:26:15,397
You gotta help me save my world.

872
01:26:23,246 --> 01:26:28,445
I know that humans aren't the strongest
species, or the smartest.

873
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,945
We're young, we have a lot to learn.

874
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:33,952
But we're worth saving.

875
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:44,963
This new weapon of yours,
you can't use it.

876
01:26:45,168 --> 01:26:48,666
Once you cross that line, once you've
given in to fear, you'll never go back.

877
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:49,832
I've seen it.

878
01:26:51,074 --> 01:26:53,907
Look, I know right now you're afraid.

879
01:26:54,077 --> 01:26:56,409
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?

880
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:57,876
Yes, I do.

881
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:00,208
That's exactly why Parallax
is beating you...

882
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:02,977
...because you're afraid
to even admit you're afraid.

883
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,710
I know.

884
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:07,089
I spent my entire life doing it.

885
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:10,884
You know, we have a saying on Earth.

886
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,585
We say, "I'm only human."

887
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:18,926
We say it because we're vulnerable,
we say it because we know we're afraid.

888
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:21,229
It doesn't mean we're weak.

889
01:27:23,473 --> 01:27:24,940
Help me save my planet.

890
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:27,408
Don't give in to fear.

891
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:30,705
Fight it. Fight it with me.

892
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:34,314
Your words are compelling, young human.

893
01:27:34,484 --> 01:27:38,147
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...

894
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:40,482
...and the fate of the universe.

895
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:45,184
We simply cannot risk losing everything
on the chance you might be right.

896
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:48,455
Then don't. Don't risk any more lives.

897
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:50,791
Just mine.

898
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:54,365
Let me go fight for my world...

899
01:27:54,537 --> 01:27:58,735
...and I'll show you
that will is stronger than fear.

900
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:01,870
There is no way you can succeed.

901
01:28:02,045 --> 01:28:04,240
You will die, Hal Jordan.

902
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:08,112
Then I'll die trying.

903
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:12,881
Good luck, Green Lantern.

904
01:29:12,215 --> 01:29:13,739
I wouldn't do that.

905
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,083
Look closely.

906
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:24,856
She's beautiful, isn't she?

907
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:28,962
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.

908
01:29:29,132 --> 01:29:32,295
But she could never see me,
as you were always standing in the way.

909
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:34,299
But not anymore.

910
01:29:34,904 --> 01:29:37,395
No! No! Don't! Don't do this, Hector.

911
01:29:37,573 --> 01:29:39,097
Please.

912
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:41,140
Please.

913
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,235
I know how you feel.

914
01:29:45,281 --> 01:29:47,306
Come on, look at yourself!

915
01:29:49,986 --> 01:29:52,147
No, I know what it's like...

916
01:29:53,456 --> 01:29:55,287
...to not live up to expectations...

917
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:58,723
...to feel like nothing that you do
will ever be good enough.

918
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:05,331
I know what it's like to be afraid.

919
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:08,232
Let me help you.

920
01:30:09,605 --> 01:30:12,472
Hal. You've changed.

921
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:17,235
How wonderful that all it took for you
to grow up was the end of the world.

922
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:20,443
Now it's my turn.

923
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:25,781
And if I can't be like you,
I'm gonna make her like me.

924
01:30:25,955 --> 01:30:28,116
And let's face it, once she's like me...

925
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:31,086
...then you wouldn't be very interested.

926
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,319
Hmm? Now, would you?

927
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:37,291
- Why can't you?
- Hmm?

928
01:30:38,668 --> 01:30:40,465
Why can't you be like me?

929
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,661
Heh. Huh?

930
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,305
Let her go...

931
01:30:48,678 --> 01:30:49,804
...and you can have it.

932
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:57,348
You can do anything.

933
01:30:58,054 --> 01:30:59,715
Be anything.

934
01:31:02,358 --> 01:31:03,791
Take it.

935
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:09,326
Let her make the choice.

936
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:16,304
Okay.

937
01:31:43,933 --> 01:31:45,264
Wow.

938
01:31:55,878 --> 01:31:57,277
Now bring her down.

939
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,076
Hal.

940
01:32:03,886 --> 01:32:04,944
I lied.

941
01:32:11,027 --> 01:32:12,551
I lied too.

942
01:32:13,296 --> 01:32:15,264
See, the way it works is...

943
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:16,693
...you have to be chosen.

944
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,408
You have failed me.

945
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,168
Stay here.

946
01:33:32,341 --> 01:33:33,706
No problem.

947
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,295
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.

948
01:34:05,408 --> 01:34:08,206
You are nothing without the ring.

949
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:36,594
<i>You must move out of the area now.</i>

950
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:39,240
<i>Please clear the streets.</i>

951
01:34:39,408 --> 01:34:41,205
<i>Clear the streets immediately.</i>

952
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,910
You can never beat this. You'll die.

953
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:48,913
At least I can get it away from here.

954
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:51,746
- How do you think you're gonna do that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

955
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:55,623
Maybe I can outthink it or...

956
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,622
The dogfight, remember?

957
01:34:57,793 --> 01:34:59,283
Those were a couple of jets.

958
01:34:59,462 --> 01:35:01,555
Unbeatable jets.

959
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:06,426
The ring chose me for a reason.

960
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,500
This is why.

961
01:35:11,073 --> 01:35:13,940
- Look, I'm probably not...
- Please don't. No.

962
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:15,508
Hey.

963
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:26,783
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation.</i>

964
01:35:26,956 --> 01:35:29,288
<i>Everyone must clear the streets</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

965
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:34,954
<i>Police emergency,</i>
<i>everyone must clear the street now.</i>

966
01:36:10,266 --> 01:36:12,700
Everybody off now! Now!

967
01:36:13,235 --> 01:36:14,463
Go! Go!

968
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:25,143
Run!

969
01:36:51,707 --> 01:36:53,299
- Run!
- Aah! Aah!

970
01:37:12,027 --> 01:37:14,757
I feel your fear growing.

971
01:37:15,164 --> 01:37:16,961
You will be dead soon.

972
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:19,930
In brightest day, in blackest night...

973
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:23,560
And when you're gone,
I'll destroy everything you ever loved.

974
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:26,731
...no evil shall escape my sight.

975
01:37:26,909 --> 01:37:30,367
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.

976
01:37:30,813 --> 01:37:34,681
Let those who worship evil's might...

977
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:39,480
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan...

978
01:37:39,655 --> 01:37:41,179
...were afraid.

979
01:37:41,357 --> 01:37:43,882
...beware my power:

980
01:37:44,426 --> 01:37:45,757
Green Lantern's light!

981
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:05,672
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.

982
01:41:07,296 --> 01:41:09,764
<i>Though his time</i>
<i>wearing the ring has been brief...</i>

983
01:41:10,866 --> 01:41:16,133
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be
remembered as long as the Corps exists.

984
01:41:16,371 --> 01:41:20,000
His actions are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.

985
01:41:21,143 --> 01:41:22,974
To overcome fear...

986
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,978
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.

987
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:37,787
As Lanterns,
we must fight with all our will.

988
01:41:39,561 --> 01:41:41,995
Our wills haven't always been united.

989
01:41:43,832 --> 01:41:45,094
It's time they were.

990
01:41:47,135 --> 01:41:49,763
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?

991
01:41:51,006 --> 01:41:53,406
You're impertinent, Hal Jordan.

992
01:41:53,575 --> 01:41:57,204
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.

993
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:01,945
It seems Abin Sur found another
just like himself.

994
01:42:43,892 --> 01:42:46,827
Wow, I am never getting used to that.

995
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,892
My new job requires that I travel.

996
01:42:57,739 --> 01:42:59,172
Be away for a while.

997
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:06,742
Away, never gone.

998
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,714
Hal.

999
01:43:12,888 --> 01:43:14,219
Yeah?

1000
01:43:14,589 --> 01:43:16,750
Can you take off the mask?

1001
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:23,261
That's really cool. Ha, ha.

1002
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,811
So, what happens now?

1003
01:43:41,049 --> 01:43:42,983
I'm gonna go look for trouble.

1004
01:44:06,508 --> 01:44:08,908
<i>Of all the Lanterns</i>
<i>who have ever worn the ring...</i>

1005
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:12,069
<i>... there was one</i>
<i>whose light shined brightest.</i>

1006
01:44:12,514 --> 01:44:15,847
<i>At first, his humanity</i>
<i>was thought to be a weakness.</i>

1007
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:19,920
<i>And yet it proved to be</i>
<i>his greatest strength.</i>
