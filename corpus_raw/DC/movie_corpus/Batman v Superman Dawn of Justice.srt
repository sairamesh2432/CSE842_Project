3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,720
There was a time above...

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,490
A time before...

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,420
There were perfect things.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,190
Diamond absolutes.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,780
But things fall...

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,229
Things on Earth,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,150
and what falls...

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,060
- ... is fallen.
- Master Wayne.  Bruce!

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Bruce, are you alright.

12
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,329
Martha...

13
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,950
In the dream
they took me to the light.

14
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,810
A beautiful lie.

15
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,040
METROPOLIS

16
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,070
METROPOLIS
HUMANITY KNOWS SUPERMAN

17
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,060
- Jack.
- Bruce.

18
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,160
Jack, listen to me.

19
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,870
I want you to get everyone
out of the building. Right now.

20
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,630
You understand?

21
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,610
Let's go.
Come on, start moving now, people.

22
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,090
Let's go.
The boss wants us out

23
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,180
of the building.
So, let's make it happen.

24
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,750
Jack.
Jack!

25
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,890
We're sorry.
All services are busy now.

26
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,940
Will you please try
you call again later.

27
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,770
Heaven god.

28
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,960
Creator of heaven and earth.

29
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,800
Have mercy on my soul.

30
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,720
JACK !!!

31
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,550
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne!

32
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,360
I can't feel my legs.

33
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,710
- I can't feel my legs.
- We need help over here!

34
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
Help me.
I can't feel my legs.

35
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,919
You're going to be okay,
you hear me?

36
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,939
Wallace.
What do they call you, Wally?

37
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,240
Huh?

38
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,530
You're the boss, Boss.

39
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,430
Alright.

40
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,000
- You're going to be okay.
- Easy, easy.

41
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,280
Come on.

42
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,390
Oh my god.
I can't feel my legs.

43
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,070
I can't...
I can't feel my legs.

44
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,050
It's okay.
You're going to be okay.

45
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,040
You're okay, alright.
Huh.

46
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,420
Okay, you know what?
We're going to find your mom.

47
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,150
Where is she?

48
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,550
18 MONTHS LATER

49
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,480
NAIROBI, AFRICA

50
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,630
Are you a terrorist, general?

51
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,570
They did not tell me
the interview was with a lady.

52
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm not a lady,
I'm a journalist.

53
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,410
What I am,
is a man with nothing,

54
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,190
except a love of my people.

55
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,890
Uh, don't open...

56
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,760
You just exposed...

57
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,230
Who's paying for these
security contractors, general?

58
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,240
Who pays for the drones that
passed over our heads at night?

59
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,450
One question begs another.

60
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,780
Yes?

61
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,450
CIA.

62
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,850
They're tracking us.

63
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,310
No!

64
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,880
Not her.

65
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,090
We just used her credentials as cover.

66
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,590
She doesn't know anything.

67
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,530
It's okay, Lois.

68
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,780
I...

69
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,840
I didn't know.

70
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,280
Ignorance
is not the same...

71
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,890
as innocence.
Miss Lane.

72
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,620
Get up!

73
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Stand up!

74
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,410
Move out!

75
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,320
Take 1 step,
you will see the inside of her head.

76
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,640
The women in the village
heard a noise.

77
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,170
Like the sky
crack open.

78
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,410
He came down,
so many dead.

79
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,370
Even worse came after.

80
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,700
The government attacked.

81
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,390
No mercy in the villages.

82
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,020
My parents tried to run...

83
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,770
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do,

84
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,750
that...
no one has asked what he should do.

85
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,540
Let the record show that
this committee holds him responsible.

86
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,910
He'll never answer to you.

87
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,420
He answers to no one.

88
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,360
Not even I think, to god.

89
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,060
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,550
I was going to cook.
Surprise you.

91
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,580
They held hearings about what happened.

92
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,580
- They're saying that...
- I don't care.

93
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,310
I don't care
what they're saying.

94
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,750
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot

95
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,100
- Think of what could have happened.
- Well, think about what did happen.

96
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,470
I didn't kill those men if
that's what they think.

97
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,860
If that's what you're saying?

98
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,660
I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.

99
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,490
I'm saying,
thank you for saving my life.

100
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm saying there's a cost.

101
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,860
I just don't know
if it's possible.

102
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,649
Don't know what's possible?

103
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,869
For you to love me
and be you.

104
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,709
Clark, you're going to
flood the apartment.

105
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,199
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,110
There has been a report of screaming
at location 1939 Harbor Way

107
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,320
Possible shots fired.

108
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,870
Go.

109
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,399
It saved us.

110
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,530
A devil.

111
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,250
It's okay.

112
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,429
It's okay.
We're-We're going to help.

113
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:44,709
It saved us.

114
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,500
Okay, we're going to
get you out of here.

115
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,709
Okay?

116
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,980
It's still here.

117
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,320
I - I don't understand.

118
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,139
AH!

119
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,969
Christ!

120
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,699
I saw him.

121
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,399
I never saw him before.
I didn't know...

122
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,129
You almost took my face off.

123
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,679
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

124
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,939
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

125
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,000
He branded him.

126
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,510
Still working.

127
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,370
You're getting slow in
your old age, Alfred.

128
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,169
It comes to us all,
master Wayne.

129
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:05,169
Even you got too old to die young,

130
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,340
and not for lack of trying.

131
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:14,389
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.

132
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,929
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

133
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,919
It's this new layer or armor.

134
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,520
I'll just have to rewire.

135
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:27,870
So...
last night was productive?

136
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,800
Nope. He's too low level,
he knew nothing.

137
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,830
This, is a man who knows things.

138
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,639
Anatoli Knyazev.
He's Russian.

139
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:41,649
Contracts all over the globe but
he's base out of the port of Gotham.

140
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,399
Weapons and human trafficking.

141
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,449
So, the "White Portuguese" is a Russian,
that's the theory.

142
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,929
No.

143
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,959
The theory is that the Russian
lead me to the man himself.

144
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,980
If he is indeed a him.

145
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,919
You don't know if he exist.
He could be a phantasm.

146
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:02,000
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

147
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,610
Ah, high state front.

148
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,610
New rules.

149
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,719
Gotham Free Press
BAT BRAND OF JUSTICE!

150
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,620
We're criminals, Alfred.

151
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:16,149
We've always been criminals,
nothing's change.

152
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,020
Oh.
Yes it has, sir.

153
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,409
Everything's change.

154
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,129
Men fall from the sky.

155
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
and gods hurl thunderbolts.

156
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:36,209
Innocents die.

157
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,389
That's how it starts.

158
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:45,169
The fever, the rage,
the feeling of... powerlessness

159
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,280
that turns good men...
cruel.

160
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,469
Justice turn dark across the harbor
when police found an alleged sex trafficker

161
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,699
apparently tortured and branded
by the Gotham bat.

162
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:07,459
The man is the second criminal
found baring the bat brand.

163
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,340
The first victim, an accused child predator
later was assaulted in prison

164
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,959
and remains in critical care
from his injuries.

165
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,280
One source tells Metropolis,
that many believed

166
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:21,419
the mark of the Bat brand in prison
essentially is a death sentence.

167
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:25,719
In other news, the mayor
has announced that Metroplis...

168
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,090
Frank, your D!
(Defense)

169
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,730
Woo.
Ah!

170
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,639
A hoi hoi.
I didn't know you were here.

171
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,500
- Man on the marquee.
- Stop, don't believe it.

172
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,340
My father named the company after himself.
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.

173
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,530
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Oh, really great.

174
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,409
Really great?
Good. Good.

175
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,990
Uh.
Follow me.

176
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,480
You know, Dad was born
in east Germany.

177
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,889
he grew up eating uh...
stale crackers.

178
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,139
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

179
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,240
and waved flowers at tyrants.

180
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,540
So, I think it was providence
that his son,

181
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,480
me, would end up with this.

182
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,969
One of my rebuild Metropolis crews
found it.

183
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,610
A little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

184
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,889
What's a rock have to do
with Homeland Security.

185
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,679
Homeland Security?
Mmm.

186
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:08,740
No, no, no... ma'am.
Planetary Security.

187
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,250
The fragment is of a
radio active Xeno mineral

188
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,699
We suspected it might have
bio interactions,

189
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,510
so, we took the sample
to AMRIID.

190
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:20,530
Where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

191
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,959
And, when we exposed
general Zod to the mineral,

192
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,649
this happened.

193
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,219
Profound biodegradation,
decaying Kryptonian cells.

194
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,429
We concluded the mineral could be weaponized,
if a large enough sample was found.

195
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:37,409
And then, among the fishes,
a whale!

196
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,870
Lying at the bottom
of the Indian Ocean

197
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,740
Emerald City.

198
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,959
Beautiful.

199
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,919
Now, Rocky is radio active,
but,

200
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:50,169
what he needs from you
is an import license.

201
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,719
And why would we
want to weaponize this material?

202
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,000
As a deterrent.
A silver bullet to keep in reserve

203
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,740
to use against the Kryptonians.
So, the day doesn't come, Madame.

204
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,030
when your children are waving daisies
at a reviewing stand.

205
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,889
Last I looked,
the only one of those

206
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,620
flying around up here
was Superman.

207
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,490
Ha.
Yes, Superman.

208
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,990
Yeah, but, there are...
there are more of them.

209
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,840
- The meta-human thesis.
- Yes, the meta-human thesis.

210
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,379
More likely than not.
These exceptional beings live among us.

211
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,189
The bases of our myths.
Gods among men upon our...

212
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,290
our little blue planet here.

213
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,969
You don't have to use
the silver bullet,

214
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,080
but, if you forge one...

215
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,790
Well, then...

216
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,250
We don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

217
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,790
Daily ?Planet
- SUPERMAN PREVENTS MISSILE STRIKE!
- HEROIC SUPERMAN RESCUE

218
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,870
BRUCE WAYNE RESCUES EMPLOYEE

219
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,899
Sir.
Get down.

220
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,980
Sir, I said,
get down, now!

221
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,260
Can we get some backup here?

222
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:52,110
Hey. Hey.
Don't do it!

223
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,629
HEY!

224
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,800
Lois.
Crime Lab, on 3.

225
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:00,830
This is Lane.

226
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,550
Kent, you're sports today.

227
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,740
I want you to follow
up on the football.

228
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,770
Underdog dreams dashed
10 yards between Gotham and glory.

229
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,719
Hey.
Are you guys watching this?

230
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,800
Emergency responders quickly created
a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park

231
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,649
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.

232
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,929
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

233
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,740
I work for Bruce Wayne!
I work for Bruce Wayne!

234
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,280
There'll be arraign on charges of
vandalism, resisting arrest

235
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,030
FALSE GOD
- and a felony charge of making terrorist threats

236
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,090
that carries up to
40 years in prison.

237
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,060
Poor son of a bitch.

238
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,610
- Jenny.
- Mm?

239
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:37,689
Headline.

240
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:42,030
"End of love affair
with man in the sky?"

241
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,389
Okay.

242
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,219
There're ways
we can help each other.

243
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:53,530
Ah.

244
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,649
Could you step
into my office here?

245
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,260
Yes!

246
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,230
What's your wish list?

247
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,699
Uh.

248
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:09,340
Access to the wreck of the
crashed Kryptonian ship.

249
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,240
Done.

250
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,590
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

251
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,560
You want Zod's body?

252
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,409
Okay.

253
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,060
It's cherry.

254
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,090
- Show him what you got!
- Dude, let's go!

255
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,179
*Make sure to hit his left.

256
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,469
Come on.
Throw a punch, will you?

257
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,209
Let's go!
Come on!

258
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,169
Thank you.

259
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,969
The house treats luck like an insult.

260
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,659
Good luck for one has always
gives others misfortune.

261
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:51,520
But, eventually,
all accounts will be settled.

262
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,860
3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,
the line was all she tell me.

263
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:57,020
Not all I'm sure.

264
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,669
Good evening.

265
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,159
DEVICE CLONING
SUCCESSFUL

266
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,290
It's like a 1 man reign of terror.

267
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,949
This bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

268
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,870
and the adjacent projects
and tenements.

269
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,020
And as far as I can tell
the cops are actually helping him.

270
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,020
Crime wave in Gotham.

271
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,399
Other breaking news.
Water, wet.

272
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,679
- Did you file the football yet?
- Why aren't we covering this?

273
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,740
Poor people don't buy papers?

274
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,399
People don't buy papers,
period, Kent.

275
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,120
Perry, when you assign a story, you're
making a choice about who matters...

276
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,060
- ... and who's worth it.
- Good morning, Smallville

277
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,260
The America conscious died
with Robert, Martin and John.

278
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,139
Sorry.
Sorry.

279
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:41,120
No match.

280
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,929
My guys in the crime lab,
never seen one before.

281
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,919
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with it.

282
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:49,740
Recovered from the scene
of the fire fight in the desert.

283
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,260
Not sold anywhere commercially
in the world, even black market.

284
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,250
So?

285
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,919
So, who gave prototype military rounds
to tribe fighters in the Sahara.

286
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,050
The ass, Lois.

287
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,129
Flight to DC tonight,
a couple of days there.

288
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,179
Go.

289
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,850
Coach.
No extra leg room.

290
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,120
Economy plus.

291
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,689
Coach!

292
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,189
Senator.

293
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,050
My dad always said that,

294
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,580
Kentucky mash
was the secret to health.

295
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,300
This was his room.

296
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,330
I left it just the way it was.

297
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,149
It's silly.
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

298
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,510
I'm blocking the import license
for your mineral.

299
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,280
The Red Capes are coming!

300
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,570
The Red Capes are coming!

301
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,020
You and your hearings...

302
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,689
galloping through the streets
to warn us.

303
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:15,219
One, if by land.
Two, if by air.

304
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,659
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

305
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,199
- Can I call you June?
- You can call me whatever you like.

306
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,209
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's peach tea.

307
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,429
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

308
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,219
You won't fool a fly on me.

309
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:42,459
I'm not going to drink it.

310
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,610
Hey, you don't think
Dad would mind, do you?

311
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,760
If I change just...

312
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,090
... just one thing in this room.

313
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:59,870
Because, that should be upside down.

314
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,260
Now, we know better now,
don't we?

315
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,399
The devils don't come from
hell beneath us. No.

316
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,790
No, they come from the sky.

317
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,400
MARTHA WAYNE
1946 - 1981

318
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,670
Wrong room, miss.

319
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,319
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

320
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,370
Miss Lane, if you like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.

321
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,799
You're treating me like a stranger?

322
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:12,870
I'm treating you like a reporter.

323
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,049
Alright.

324
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:18,430
Is the US providing experimental
military arms to rebels in Africa?

325
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,620
You know with balls like yours.

326
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,759
You belong in here.

327
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:26,089
Who's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

328
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,410
No, not tin,
but it's metal.

329
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,180
Fired in the Superman incident.
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

330
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,779
- We haven't been told the truth.
- Here's the truth.

331
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,650
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

332
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,310
Superman acted like some... rogue combatant
to rescue her and people died.

333
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,950
Don't invent a conspiracy theory
to put back his halo.

334
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,230
Or yours.

335
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,830
- Major.
- Sir.

336
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,040
Oh.

337
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:58,950
I hope the next generation of Waynes
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

338
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,440
Don't think there's a likely
to be a next generation.

339
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,069
Thank you, sir.

340
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,029
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

341
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,950
Two mentions of business
with the "White Portuguese" and

342
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,569
it's continuing transmitting black out
data to the personal residence

343
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:21,069
of Alexandra Luthor.

344
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,390
You think Lex Luthor
is the "White Portuguese"?

345
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,750
I can't see that he needs
the income from imported arms.

346
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,880
Regardless, I'll need to
put a 'leech' in his house,

347
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,230
and I'm going
to need the suit.

348
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,120
The Bat interrogated 6 people
and came away with nothing.

349
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:40,339
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

350
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

351
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,730
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

352
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,259
He's been invited.

353
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,960
HA HA HA
Joke's on you
BATMAN

354
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,110
- That's him right there!
- There he is! Get a shot!

355
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,960
- Bruce, over here!
- Bruce, Bruce.

356
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,420
- Wayne, have a shot.
- Mr. Wayne!

357
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,480
- Right here, one second.
- This way, Mr. Wayne!

358
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,339
Who's that?

359
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,270
You must be new to the
let them eat cake beat.

360
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,930
That is Bruce Wayne.

361
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,509
Philanthropist.
Bibliophile.

362
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:08,560
True friend of the library of Metropolis.
Mr. Lex Luthor.

363
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,240
Nikki.

364
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,040
You're embarrassing me.

365
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,380
Speech. Speech.
Uh, blah blah blah.

366
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,790
Open bar.

367
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,430
The word Philanthropist,
comes from the Greek.

368
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,970
Meaning a lover of humanity

369
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,710
It was coined about,
2,500 years ago...

370
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,270
Alright, where am I going, Alfred?

371
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,500
Approach the elevator,
to your left.

372
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,549
That where it must be.

373
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,680
It's in the service
corridor in the basement.

374
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,680
Go down the stairs.

375
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,870
Prometheus went with us,

376
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,640
and he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy man kind

377
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,569
and for that, he was given a thunderbolt.
Chooo!

378
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:00,839
Hm.
That seems unfair.

379
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,589
On the serious note,
the library of Metropolis...

380
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,759
Down the stairs.
It's the only way in, down the stairs.

381
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,589
But, at one time,
Dad could not either.

382
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,480
No, my father could not
afford the books, so...

383
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,779
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.

384
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,890
Now you got the kitchens
on your right.

385
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,750
To the left.

386
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:22,339
Right in front of you,
that's where you want to be.

387
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,250
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

388
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:43,990
Uh, I just...
thought the bathroom was down here.

389
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,240
I must have...

390
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,020
That last Martini was a...
too too many, I think.

391
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,600
- Men's room is upstairs.
- Great, I'm okay.

392
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,880
I like those shoes.

393
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:00,970
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

394
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,630
Go upstairs and socialize.

395
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,970
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

396
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,560
In your dreams, Alfred.

397
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:12,970
Books are knowledge,
and knowledge is puff worth.

398
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,150
And I am...
Heh heh heh, no.

399
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,290
I, umm.

400
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,580
No, what am I?
Alright, what am I suppose to say?

401
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,850
No.

402
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:25,009
The bitter sweet pain among man
is having knowledge with no power.

403
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:26,580
Because...

404
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,839
Because that is paradoxical,
and umm...

405
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,850
Thank you for coming.

406
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,779
Please, drink, it's free.

407
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,710
Mr. Wayne.
Mr. Wayne.

408
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,350
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

409
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,350
Oh, my foundation has already issued
a statement in support of the... cause.

410
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,900
I'm sorry?

411
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,950
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me, alright?

412
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:03,210
What's your position on the
bat vigilante in Gotham?

413
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:04,930
Daily Planet.

414
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,220
Wait, do I own this one?
Or was that the other guy?

415
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,230
Civil liberties has been
trampled on in your city.

416
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,490
Good people living in fear.

417
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,230
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

418
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,330
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.

419
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,490
He thinks he's above the law.

420
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,799
The Daily Planet criticizing those
who think they're above the laws.

421
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:28,810
A little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?

422
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,600
Considering every time your hero
saves a cat out of a tree,

423
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,140
you write a puff piece editorial,
about an alien who...

424
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,170
if he wanted to,
could burn the whole place down.

425
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,450
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we can do to stop him.

426
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,720
Most of the world doesn't share
your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

427
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,839
Maybe it's the...
Gotham City and me, we just...

428
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,790
... have a bad history with
freaks dressed like clowns.

429
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,640
Boys!
Mm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent.

430
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,339
Ah, I love it!
I love bringing people together!

431
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,690
- How are we?
- Lex.

432
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,000
Hello, good.
Hi, hello.

433
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,630
Lex. It is a pleasure... Ow!
Wow, that is a good grip!

434
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,660
You should,
not pick a fight with this person.

435
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,500
So, after all these years,
we've finally got you over to Metropolis.

436
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,970
- Well, I thought I come drink you dry.
- Well, you're welcome.

437
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,410
You should hop the hub more often though,
I love to show you my labs.

438
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,100
Maybe we could,
be partner on something.

439
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,350
My R&D is up to
all sorts of no good.

440
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:30,640
TRANSFER COMPLETE
- That's 7 minutes.

441
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,970
Look likes the transfer's complete.

442
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,240
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes.

443
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:36,150
- The governor.
- Governor.

444
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,490
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

445
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,470
- Governor, hi.
- Lex, it's good to see you.

446
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,060
"... a deadly factory fire has interrupted
the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez."

447
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,740
Excuse me.

448
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:37,319
"I can't believe they're
going to let that poor girl die."

449
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,910
We, as a population on this planet,
have been looking for a savior.

450
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,540
90% of people believe
in a higher power.

451
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:35,839
And every religion believes
in some sort messianic figure.

452
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,040
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,

453
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,290
we want to make him abide
by our rules?

454
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,480
We have to understand that
this is a paradigm shift.

455
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,940
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.

456
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,600
Are there any
moral constraints on this person?

457
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,640
We have international law.

458
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,990
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.

459
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:58,130
Is it really surprising,
that the most powerful man in the world

460
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,250
should be a figure of controversy?

461
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:06,180
To have an individual engaging
in the state level interventions

462
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,299
should give us all pause.

463
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,730
Human beings have a horrible track record
of following people with great power,

464
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,210
down paths that lead to
huge human monstrosities.

465
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,049
We have always created icons
in our own image.

466
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:22,490
What we've done is we project
ourselves on to him.

467
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:26,310
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.

468
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,640
Maybe heâs just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

469
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,990
Weâre talking about a being
whose very existence

470
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:36,450
challenges our own sense of
priority in the universe.

471
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,940
If you go back to Copernicus,
where he restored

472
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,370
the sun and the center of the
known universe, displacing Earth.

473
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,339
And you get to Darwinian evolution

474
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,390
and you find out,
we're not special on this Earth

475
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,120
we're just one among
other life forms.

476
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,700
And now we learned, that we're not
even special in the entire universe

477
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,420
because there is Superman.

478
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,130
There he is, an alien,
among us.

479
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,180
We're not alone.

480
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,680
Are you, as a United State Senator,
personally comfortable

481
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:11,520
saying to a grieving parent,
"Superman could've saved your child,

482
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,630
but on principle
we did not want him to act."

483
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

484
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,549
I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.

485
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,640
What are we talking about here then?

486
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,270
Must there be a Superman?

487
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,080
There is.

488
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:38,020
Keefe, you made bail.
Open Two.

489
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,680
Who paid?

490
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,020
Who the hell are you?

491
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,430
- Just a man.
- Yeah?

492
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,279
Well, what do you want?

493
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,200
To help you stand for something.

494
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,480
Your 3 o'clock's here.

495
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,290
He made me half a man.

496
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:36,140
Let me face him.

497
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,950
So, I logged into your drop box
to find a copy.

498
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,930
There's a copy, alright.

499
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,190
But, nothing about football.
Nothing about...

500
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,600
Friends of the Metropolis Library,
just...

501
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,350
The god damn Gotham bat thing,
I told you not to pursue.

502
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,690
The police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

503
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,420
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

504
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,779
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

505
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,700
So could you, if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

506
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,049
WPA aren't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

507
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,710
Not in here. Not out there.
You drop this thing.

508
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:17,029
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

509
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:20,710
It's the sword of Alexander.

510
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:24,060
It's the blade that
cut the Gordian Knot.

511
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,509
- It's a triumph.
- Yes.

512
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,940
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

513
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,690
It's a fake.

514
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,730
The real was sold in '98
on the black market.

515
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,380
- Now it hangs...
- Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

516
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,960
Excuse me.

517
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,870
Excuse me, Miss.

518
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,200
The other night, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

519
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,319
Stealing's not polite.

520
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,720
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

521

01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:13,230
in those horrific events in Metropolis
that happened 2 years ago.

699
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,690
Bruce, NO TRUCE
- Jesus.

700
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,290
- B WAYNE, I HAUNT YOU
- BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND

701
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,610
Why haven't I seen this?

702
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,820
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

703
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,650
And there he is.
Superman is here.

704
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,880
He's actually at the
United States capitol.

705
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,140
This is really a historic moment.

706
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,430
Nor we expect that Superman would give
some kind of a statement to the Senate

707
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,950
to the American people,
and of course to the world.

708
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,590
He's here.
He came.

709
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,940
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ow.

710
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,810
You are going to be on the
hot seat in there, June bun.

711
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,370
I grew up on a farm.

712
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,380
I know how to wrestle a pig.

713
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,990
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

714
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,620
It's that power can be innocent.

715
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,890
Good luck.

716
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,370
Freddy, good to go.

717
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,450
- SUPERMAN=ILLEGAL ALIEN
- THIS IS OUR WORLD, NOT YOURS!

718
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,770
- EARTH BELONGS TO HUMANS
- GOD HATES ALIENS

719
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,200
GET OUT!

720
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,940
GET OUT!
GET OUT!

721
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:29,020
Another one came this morning
Mr. Wayne.

722
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,420
Let me say at the outset that
I am grateful to our witness

723
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,010
for coming before us today.

724
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,070
This is how a democracy works.

725
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,900
We talk to each other.

726
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:23,880
We act by the consent
of the govern, sir,

727
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,310
I have sat here before

728
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:30,750
to say that shadow interventions
will not tolerate by this Committee.

729
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,410
Neither will lies.

730
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,400
Because today is a day for truth.

731
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:41,960
Because only by speaking...

732
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:56,170
Only by working...
together, can we...

733
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,440
can we...
can we...

734
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,490
can we create a free and a...

735
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,950
GRANNY'S PEACH TEA

736
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,520
Mr. Lex Luthor
CEO - Lexcorp

737
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,920
Oh, my God!

738
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,710
WAYNE TOWER DEVASTATED
YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE

739
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,010
LEXCORP

740
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,860
Capitol Police are confirming to CNN
that the suspected bomber is

741
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,250
Wallace Vernon Keefe
Now these sources also say...

742
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,210
Clarke, it's me again.
Can you...

743
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,410
gotten explosive device
into the hearing

744
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,930
by concealing them
inside his wheelchair.

745
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,390
As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.

746
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,730
I didn't see it, Lo.

747
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,890
Standing right there
and I didn't see it.

748
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,530
Clark, there are people behind this.

749
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,440
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

750
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,850
All this time.

751
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:56,330
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

752
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,270
Mending wrongs for a ghost.

753
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,740
Thinking I'm here to do good.

754
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,110
Superman was never real.

755
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:13,290
It's just a dream of
a farmer from Kansas.

756
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,710
That farmer's dream is
all some people have.

757
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,150
It's all that gives them hope.

758
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,250
This means something.

759
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,380
It did on my world.

760
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,460
My world doesn't exist anymore.

761
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,110
Wel..
Wel... come...

762
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,610
Welcome.

Would you, like to assume command?

765
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,100
Yes, I would.

766
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,920
Yes, I would.

767
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:15,070
Very well.
Let's begin.

768
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:20,470
The Kryptonian archives contains knowledge
from 100,000 different worlds.

769
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,810
Good.

770
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,680
Teach me.

771
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,440

780
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,350
Alexander Luthor, your security override
has been accepted.

781
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:57,010
Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.

782
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:02,700
Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.

783
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:04,440
Analyzing.

784
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,270
I've identified the host as
General Zod of Kandor.

785
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,590
Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.

786
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,900
- Oh.
- Analyzing.

787
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,520
You flew too close to the sun.

788
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:37,970
Now look at you.

789
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:42,080
Advising.
Action forbidden.

790
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,690
It is been decreed
by the Council of Krypton

791
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:48,180
that none will ever again
give life to a deformity

792
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,630
so hateful to sighted memory.

793
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,050
The desecration without name.

794
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:56,330
And where is the Council of Krypton?

795
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,230
Destroyed, sir.

796
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,530
Then proceed.

797
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,240
Very well.

798
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,720
Preparing chrysalis and
commencing metamorphosis.

799
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,530
"And so, we are left to wonder,

800
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:12,930
" If Superman was aware
of the threat and did nothing,

801
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,330
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"

802
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,370
Still no Kent?

803
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,550
"His disappearance raises questions."

804
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:20,470
No.

805
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,620
"How could he simply have disappeared
at a time when we, as a nation,

806
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,580
need him more than ever?"

807
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,370
WAS SUPERMAN INVOLVED?

808
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:32,560
Burn him!
Burn him!

809
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,900
Something, isn't it?

810
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:21,240
We met Kansas, live on a pancake
so we come to the mountains.

811
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,470
All downhill from here.

812
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,460
Down to the flood plain.

813
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:28,800
The farm is at the
bottom of the world.

814
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,040
I remember one season
water came bad.

815
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,090
I couldn't been 12.

816
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,060
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

817
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,120
We worked until
I think I fainted.

818
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:42,630
But we managed to
stop the water.

819
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,470
We saved the farm.

820
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:50,230
Your grandma baked me a cake.
She said I was a hero.

821
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,490
Later that day we found out.

822
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,870
We blocked the water, alright,
we sent it upstream.

823
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,190
All alike farm washed away.

824
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,600
While eating my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

825
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,670
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.

826
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,250
Did the nightmares ever stop?

827
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,100
Yeah.

828
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,860
When I met your mother.

829
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,730
She gave me faith that
there is good in this world.

830
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,030
She was my world.

831
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,990
I miss you, son.

832
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:43,620
I miss you too, Dad.

833
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,520
You know you can't win.

834
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,660
It's suicide.

835
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,270
I'm older now than
my father ever was.

836
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:19,900
This maybe the only thing
I do that matters.

837
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,910
20 years of fighting criminals
amount to nothing?

838
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,540
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

839
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,570
Pull 1 up, another
grows in it's place.

840
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,780
This is about the future
of the world.

841
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:36,690
It's my legacy.

842
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:40,220
You know, my father sat
me down, right here.

843
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,460
Told me what Wayne manor
was built of.

844
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:45,930
Railways, real estates
and oil.

845
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,630
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.

846
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,900
Pelts and skins.

847
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,050
They were hunters.

848
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,640
We got to wait for more evidence,
but the question still remains,

849
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,320
where is he?

850
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,930
If Superman was not involved,

851
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,410
If he's got nothing to hide,

852
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,970
then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?

853
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,480
Look, you can't...

854
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,440
The knight is here.

855
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,610
Excuse me.

856
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,100
Don't I know you...

857
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,300
Plain lo, in the morning
Lola in slacks.

858
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,660
Lois Lane.

859
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,180
Mmm.
Come see the view.

860
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,060
Now, the secret is the height.

861
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,230
It's the building material.

862
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,320
it's light metals, which...
sway a bit in the wind.

863
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,750
And you know something about LEXCORP metals,
don't you, Miss Lane?

864
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,500
I've proven what you've done.

865
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:37,670
Wow, you're feisty.

866
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,390
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

867
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,080
Like sand in the desert.

868
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,430
You're psychotic.

869
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:47,700
That is a three syllable word for
any thought too big for little minds.

870
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,110
Next category: Circles.

871
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:54,910
Round and round and round
they go to find Superman.

872
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,190
Wrong category, boy.
No, not triangles.

873
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,710
Yes, Euclidean triangle inequality

874
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,590
The shortest distance between
any 2 points is a straight path.

875
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:05,580
And I believe the swiftest path
to Superman...

876
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:10,180
.. is a pretty little road.
Mmm, called Lois Lane.

877
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:14,220
Aahhhhhh!!

878
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:33,980
You came back.

879
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,090
You came back.

880
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:57,830
Boy, do we have problems up here!

881
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,260
The problem of,
of evil in the world.

882
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,350
The problem of absolute virtue.

883
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,040
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.

884
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:12,760
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

885
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,630
You above all.

886
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,670
Ah.
'Cause that's what God is.

887
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,420
Horus. Apollo.
Jehovah. Kal-El.

888
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,160
Clark Joseph Kent.

889
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:31,130
See. What we call God depends
upon our tribe, Clark Jo.

890
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,330
Because God is tribal.
God takes sides.

891
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,290
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

892
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,370
to deliver me from Daddy's fist
and abominations. Mm mm.

893
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,400
I've figured it out way back,

894
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:45,390
if God is all powerful,
he cannot be all good.

895
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,090
And if he's all good
then he cannot be all powerful.

896
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,440
And neither can you be.

897
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:55,490
They need to see
the fraud you are.

898
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,830
With their eyes.

899
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,090
The blood on your hands.

900
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,720
What have you done?

901
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,370
And tonight they will.

902
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:08,330
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date!

903
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,910
Across the bay.

904
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,310
Ripe fruit, his hate.
2 years growing.

905
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,450
But it did not take much
to push him over actually.

906
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,260
Little red notes, big bang.
You let your family die!

907
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,410
And now, you will fly to him,

908
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,750
and you will battle him,

909
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,780
to the death.

910
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:30,730
Black and Blue.
Fight night!

911
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,180
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

912
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,410
God vs man.

913
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,260
Day vs night.

914
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,990
Son of Krypton vs
Bat of Gotham.

915
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,360
You think I'll fight him for you?

916
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,420
Yes, I do.

917
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,610
I think you'll fight, fight, fight
for that special lady in your life.

918
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,230
She's safe on the ground.
How about you?

919
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,440
Close, but I'm not
talking about Lois.

920
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:00,250
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

921
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,450
Huh!

922
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:08,250
Martha, Martha, Martha.

923
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,630
The mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

924
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:16,730
The punishment for witches, what is that?

925
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,520
That's right.
Death by fire.

926
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,710
Where is she?

927
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,450
I don't know!
I wouldn't let them tell me!

928
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,990
If you kill me, Martha dies.

929
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,070
And if you fly away, Martha also dies.
but if you kill the Bat...

930
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,810
Martha lives.

931
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:50,020
There we go.
There we go.

932
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:56,450
And now God,
bends to my will.

933
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,690
Now the cameras are waiting
at your ship.

934
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,990
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

935
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,950
Yes, the all mighty comes clean about
how dirty he is when it counts.

936
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:13,800
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.

937
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,830
Mother of God,
would you look at the time.

938
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,720
When you came here,
you had an hour.

939
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,530
Now it's less.

940
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:04,950
CNN's Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.

941
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:07,130
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What do you see?

942
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,710
There's something happening at the ship.

943
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,300
It's sending massive power surges.

944
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:17,430
The police created a barricade
around this containment center.

945
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,380
And we're trying to get a little bit closer
here to find out what's going on.

946
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,740
It is absolute chaos.
You can see that lightning.

947
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,570
Those surges are like increasing and

948
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,670
they seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.

949
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,560
Daily Planet.

950
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,930
Lois.

951
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,300
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

952
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,720
Who?

953
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,300
Or he has to die.

954
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,120
Clark.

955
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,310
No one stays good in this world.

Chopper?
We can barely afford a bicycle.

980
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,890
You want to chase a story?

981
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,370
Go to the ship.
Superman's probably there already.

982
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,610
Perry, it's not for a story.

983
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,690
Jenny, get her a
chopper to Gotham.

984
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,360
And forget the heliport,
put her on the god damn roof.

985
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,330
On the roof, Lois!

986
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,170
Where're we headed?

987
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,800
There!

988
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:31,250
Well.
Here I am.

989
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,210
Bruce.
Please

990
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:37,930
I was wrong.
You have to listen to me.

991
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,820
Lex wants us...

992
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,940
You don't understand.

993
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,900
There's no time!

994
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,720
I understand.

995
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:01,700
Stay down!

996
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:04,890
If I wanted it,
you'd be dead already!

997
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,700
Breathe in.

998
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,560
That's fear.

999
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:52,770
You're not brave.

1000
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,790
Men are brave.

1001
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:47,120
I bet your parents taught you,
that you mean something.

1002
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,960
That you're here for a reason.

1003
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:53,680
My parents taught me
a different lesson.

1004
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,780
Dieing in the gutter.

1005
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,250
For no reason at all.

1006
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:20,620
They taught me the world only
makes sense, if you force it to.

1007
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,640
You were never a god.

1008
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:06,130
You are never even a man.

1009
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:16,780
You're letting him...
kill Martha.

1010
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,260
What does that mean?

1011
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:26,450
Why did you say that name?

1012
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:30,340
Find him!

1013
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:32,740
Save...

1014
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,860
Martha.

1015
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:39,410

1018
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,960
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?

1019
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,550
Martha!
Why did you say that name?

1020
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,910
Clark!
Stop!

1021
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,150
Please!
Stop!

1022
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,830
Why did you say that name?

1023
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,850
It's his mother's name.

1024
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,460
It's his mother's name.

1025
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,260
We're no getting any answers.
We're still right outside the containment center.

1026
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,540
A dangerous situation.

1027
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:08,960

surrounding the area.

1028
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,270
Luthor.

1029
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:28,370
He wanted your life for her's.

1030
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:30,690
She's losing time.

1031
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,610
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1032
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,150
It's got to be Lex.

1033
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,170
They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.

1034
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,860
- My mother needs me.
- Wait!

1035
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:43,610
I'll make you a promise.

1036
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:45,980
Martha won't die tonight.

1037
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:15,330
- Master Wayne.
- Alfred.

1038
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:17,040
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in.

1039
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:20,310
But I've tracked the Russian's phone
to a warehouse near the port.

1040
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:22,450
You're locked on to it.

1041
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:41,300
I'm afraid, this is goodbye.

1042
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:48,020
I heard everytime we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1043
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,720
Go!
Go!

1044
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:27,610
You got to take it, Alfred.

1045
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,570
Ah.
Right.

1046
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,950

1047
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:38,930

two dozen hostile's on the third floor.

1048
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,050
Why don't I drop you off
on the second?

1049
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:35,360
Drop it.

1050
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,270
I said, drop it!

1051
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,070
I'll kill her.

1052
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:44,460
Believe me, I'll do it!

1053
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:49,190
I believe you.

1054
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:03,680
It's okay.
I'm a friend of your son.

1055
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:07,210
I figured.
The cape.

1056
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:36,310
"Late, late", says the White Rabbit.

1057
01:54:36,330 --> 01:54:38,110
30 seconds to animation.

1058
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,590
Right, rabbit?
Hmm.

1059
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:44,130
Out of tricks.
Out of time.

1060
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:47,070
And 1 bat head short.

1061
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:49,390
20 seconds to animation.

1062
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51,840
Ah. That will be the cook.
Excuse me.

1063
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:54,790
Ah, Gotham roast.
Well done.

1064
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,910
Hello.
Break the bad news.

1065
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:59,760
I'd rather do the
breaking in person.

1066
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,550
10 seconds to animation.

1067
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:02,630
You lost.

1068
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,350
9.
8.

1069
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,590
I cannot let you win.

1070
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,290
I gave the bat a fighting chance to do it.,
but he was not strong enough.

1071
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:10,110
So, If man won't kill God,

1072
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:12,750
2.
1.

1073
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:15,960
the Devil will do it!

1074
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,460
- Perry.
- Alright. Stay calm, everybody!

1075
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:37,270
We're getting reports,
there are total blackouts

1076
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,730
in the north and to the
northwest of the city.

1077
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:44,610
Federal authorities are trying to determine
if this is part of a larger terrorist attack.

1078
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:51,660
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1079
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,300
The blood of my blood.

1080
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:04,120
Born to destroy you.

1081
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,560
Your Doomsday.

1082
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:36,750
Now God is good...
as dead.

1083
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,590
POTUS joining.

1084
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:03,790
- Mr. President.
- What the hell is it, Calvin?

1085
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:06,500
These are live images from the
top of the LEXCORP tower

1086
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:10,860
in downtown metropolis.
Military aircraft are on the scene.

1087
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:19,070
This thing emerged from the
Kryptonian crash site just moments ago.

1088
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,240
Thankfully the work day is over

1089
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:23,850
in the downtown core,
it's nearly empty

1090
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,870
Now.
Military aircraft

1091
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:29,030
Those are Apache helicopters,
they have now just arrived.

1092
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:30,380
The image...

1093
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:01,880
We have uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 news.

1094
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:05,160
Now, it's not clear
what just happened.

1095
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,970
What happening there, Alfred?

1096
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,150
How best to describe it?

1097
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:15,070
Metropolis airspace has been closed briefly.

1098
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:17,150
- Excuse me.
- I kindly ask you to stay in your seats.

1099
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:18,750
Excuse me?

1100
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:20,830
Miss Prince?

1101
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:36,160
Sir.
Look, they cleared the city.

1102
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:38,110
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1103
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:40,070
We can go straight to Key RED,
Mr. President.

1104
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,510
Not yet.
Are you crazy?

1105
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:44,350
They are high enough and we can
nuke them with no casualties. Sir.

1106
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:48,080
One casualty, Mr. President.
Superman.

1107
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:52,300
God have mercy on us all.

1108
01:59:57,210 --> 01:59:59,070
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1109
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,210
Red Birds,
are armed to deploy, Sir.

1110
02:00:02,810 --> 02:00:04,090
Fire at will.

1111
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:07,220
3. 2. 1.

1112
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,880
Oh, God.

1113
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:14,320
Projectile 1.
Impact.

1114
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,230
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1115
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:17,700
That's uninhabited.

1116
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:19,670
Projectile 2.

1117
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:26,750
No apparent re-entry.

1118
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,710
Projectile 2?

1119
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:34,330
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 is Superman.

1120
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,580
Sir.

1121
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,880
It's moving.

1122
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:21,000
The shock waves are getting stronger.

1123
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:24,040
Everytime we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1124
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:26,100
We can't attack.

1125
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:29,160
What're you saying, Calvin?

1126
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,430
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1127
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:02,550
- Master Wayne, are you receiving me?
- Alfred.

1128
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:06,830
It's Kryptonian.
Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.

1129
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:10,430
It might,
if you have any left.

1130
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:12,590
I only got 1 round left.

1131
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,330
The spear.
Alfred, the spear.

1132
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:19,270
It's pure kryptonite.
It's back in Gotham.

1133
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:22,430
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.

1134
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:25,160
- It would in theory.
- I got to get it to chase me.

1135
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:28,410
Back to the city.
Back to the kryptonite.

1136
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:28,770
Oh, shit.

1137
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:19,960
Why did you bring him
back to the city?

1138
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,510
The port is abandoned.

1139
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:24,000
And there's a weapon here
that can kill it.

1140
02:05:36,070 --> 02:05:37,990
Did you find the spear?

1141
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:39,580
I've been a little busy.

1142
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:44,120
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1143
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:48,100
This thing is from another world.

1144
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,350
My world.

1145
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,480
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1146
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:56,570
Is she with you?

1147
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:58,720
I thought she was with you.

1148
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,110
Clark.

1149
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,700
Clark.

1150
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:57,030
Clark.

1151
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,510
Clark.
Are you alright?

1152
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,850
I love you.

1153
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,590
No.

1154
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:46,200
No, Clark, you can't.

1155
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,210
This is my world.

1156
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,220
No, Clark, don't.

1157
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,780
You are my world.

1158
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,340
No.

1159
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:03,390
Please.
Clark!

1160
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:18,770
SUPERMAN DEAD
NIGHT OF TERROR, MORNING OF LOSS

1161
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,980
Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent
Killed Reporting Gotham Battle

1162
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:24,400
Lex Luthor Arrested In Connection
With Capitol Bombing.

1163
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,780
Hi.

1164
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:14,940
Clark had this sent here
so he can surprise you.

1165
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:40,880
All the circuses back east,
burying an empty box.

1166
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,700
They don't know how
to honor him.

1167
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:46,650
Except as a soldier.

1168
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:51,660
I've failed him,
in life.

1169
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:55,050
I won't fail him in death.

1170
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:59,000
Help me find the others like you.

1171
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:01,700
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1172
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,280
They will.
And they'll fight.

1173
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,500
We have to stand together.

1174
02:19:15,559 --> 02:19:19,260
A 100 years ago
I walked away from mankind.

1175
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:23,630
From the century of horrors.

1176
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:30,510
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1177
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,580
Man is still good.

1178
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:41,160
We fight.
We kill.

1179
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,170
We betray one another.

1180
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,090
But we can rebuild.

1181
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:51,250
We can do better.

1182
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:54,520
We will.

1183
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:56,400
We have to.

1184
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:18,040
IF YOU SEEK HIS
MONUMENT
LOOK AROUND YOU

1185
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:20,280
The others like me.

1186
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:23,020
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?

1187
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:29,970
Just a feeling.

1188
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:42,290
Turn around and face the wall.

1189
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:46,210
Place your forehead
against the wall.

1190
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,010
Put your hands behind your back,

1191
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:50,540
so that I can come in
and restrain you.

1192
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:21,380
Whatever you do.
Wherever you go.

1193
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,780
I'll be watching.

1194
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:31,540
But, the bells are already been rung,

1195
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,630
and they've heard it.

1196
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,570
Out in the dark.

1197
02:21:38,590 --> 02:21:41,090
Among the stars.

1198
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:48,310
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1199
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:00,580
The bells, cannot be unrung!

1200
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:05,640
He's hungry.
He's found us.

1201
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:08,170
And he's coming!

1202
02:22:10,860 --> 02:22:13,870
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding.

1203
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:18,910
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.

1204
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:24,350
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.

1205
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:28,750
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.

1206
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:33,910
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.
