<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

5

<i>like a beautiful dream of
when the whole world felt like a promise</i>

6
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,706

yet unseen.</i>

7

humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

24
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,764
I can do it.

25
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,892
Just do your best.

26
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,310
And remember,

27
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,896
greatness is not what you think.

28

[Young Diana] No!

That's not fair!

51
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,657
No.

52
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,951
No. But...

53
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,120
- You took the short path.
- [Young Diana] But...

54
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,663
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

55
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,789
But that...

56
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,250
That is the truth.

57
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,752
That is the only truth,

58
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,004
and truth is all there is.

59
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,338
But I would've won, if you didn't...

60
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,382
But you didn't.

61
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,720
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

62
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,680
and there is no shame in that.

63
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,015
[sighs tearfully]

64
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,477

When?

70
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,496
When you're ready.

71
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,041
Look to the Golden Warrior Asteria.

72
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,879
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

73
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,466
She did it through true acts of bravery.

74
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,136
Like patience, diligence,

75
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,306
and the courage to face the truth.

77
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,399

[Courtney] Oh, my gosh!

182
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,711
Hold tight.

183
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,299
[laughing]

184
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,511
[both screaming]

185
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,849
I hate guns.

186
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,809
We've got to go now. Come on.

187
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,647
[gasps]

188
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:39,833
[screaming]

189
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,210
[yelping]

190
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,506
- [coins clinking]
- [Scowler] Yo.

191
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,843
I'm sorry, lady.

192
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,261
- Shh.
- [Scowler] I'm sorry. Okay?

193
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,054
It was his idea.

194
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,849
- [sirens wailing]
- [people screaming]

195
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,856
[thieves groaning]

196
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,567
[reporter on TV] <i>And the authorities
still have questions.</i>

197
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,195
<i>In fact, the first is a real doozy,
which is,</i>

198
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,947
<i>who exactly even stopped this crime?</i>

199
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,575
If the story around here
is to be believed,

200
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,577
it wasn't the police,

201
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,622
but a mysterious female savior

202
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,415
that multiple witnesses saw.

203
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,876
<i>If this sounds familiar, it should.</i>

204
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,796
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

205
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,425
<i>across the greater D. C. area
in the last year.</i>

206
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,220
<i>Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,</i>

207
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,430
<i>who is this woman</i>

208
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,766
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

209
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,681
[door closes]

210
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,822
[people laughing]

211
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,095
[waiter] Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

212
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,347
No. Just me.

213
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,194
[sighs]

214
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,908
[man] Taxi!

215
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,417
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

216
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,337
Hey, we could share, if you like?

217
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,714
No, thanks. I'll wait.

218
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,303
[airplane passing]

219
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,841
[objects clattering]

220
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,635
[gasps] Oh, my.

221
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,261
[male co-workers chattering]

222
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,556
- Yeah.
- [Barbara] Hey, Jake.

223
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,350
Jake, hi. Can you...

224
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,686
[male co-workers continue chattering]

225
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,483
Hi. [chuckles] I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

226
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,321
Good morning.

227
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,824
Hi. Thank you.

228
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,494
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.

229
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,163
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,

230
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,665
and part-time cryptozoologist.

231
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,666
Oh, wow.

232
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,751
I kept busy in college.

233
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,549
Sorry. It's these heels, you know.
It's stupid.

234
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,551
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

235
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,469
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

236
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,389
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

237
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,765
I like those.

238
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,183
Animal print. [growls]

239
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,393
[both laugh]

240
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,686
Do you want to get lunch?

241
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,396
I, uh...

242
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,981
Not now, obviously.

243
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,817
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

244
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,360
Like, around... Like, at lunchtime?

245
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,612
I have a lot of work today.

246
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,948
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

247
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,909
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

248
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,663
Ah! Diana, do you happen to know
who a Barbara Minerva is?

249
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,415
[Barbara] Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

250
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,418
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

251
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,795
- Started last week.
- Oh!

252
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,172
Gemologist?

253
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,090
Yes. And zoologist.

254
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,758
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

255
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,554
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

256
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,097
[Barbara] The FBI?

257
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,974
- [Carol] Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

258
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,350
The mall heist yesterday,

259
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,644
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

260
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,729
[Diana] Front for what?

261
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,524
Black market. Stolen jewels and art
meant for private buyers.

262
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,568
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

263
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,488
My help? [laughs]
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

264
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,281
with whatever they need.

265
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,532
Is that a yes?

266
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,992
Yes. I would, um...

267
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,952
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

268
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,121
It's nice to meet you.

269
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,789
We've met.

270
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,709
Have a nice day.

271
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,127
Bye, Diana.

272
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:22,133
[Barbara] Okay, item number 23.

273
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,344
[sighs] Shoot. That's not it.

274
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,018
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

275
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,314
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Señora de Atocha.</i>

276
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:37,941
Wow.

277
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,653
Sorry. I couldn't resist coming to see.

278
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,571
Oh, it's okay.

279
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,740
Here it is.

280
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,117
- [Diana] What is it?
- Um...

281
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,495
Uh...

282
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,206
I can't tell.

283
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,460
Some light.

284
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,592
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

285
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,761
[Barbara chuckles] Um...

286
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,180
It's... It's citrine.

287
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:13,142
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history. [sighs]

288
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,729
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

289
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:17,855
What do you think?

290
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,775
Fakes aren't my forte, but let me see.

291
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,777
Mmm.

292
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,237
Latin.

293
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,822
[Barbara] At least
it's an antique, right?

294
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,033
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

295
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,994
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

296
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,706
"Place upon the object held

297
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,541
but one great wish."

298
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,001
You read Latin?

299
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,087
Yeah. Yeah. Languages are a hobby.

300
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,880
So maybe it's, like, a lucky charm
or something?

301
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,090
Yeah, I guess.

302
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,216
Strange.

303
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,552
- I really wish I had a coffee.
- [Barbara laughs]

304
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,470
You're funny.

305
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,140
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

306
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,559
[laughs] What? Yeah, I'll take one.

307
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,311
Ooh, hot!

308
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,478
- Hot, hot!
- [Barbara gasps]

309
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,938
Did you see that?

310
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,567
Oh...

311
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,486
Can you imagine?

312
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,697
- If only.
- Hmm.

313
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,202
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

314
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,792
I do.

315
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,170
[sighs]

316
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,632
Well, um, anyway, sorry to bother you.

317
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,176
If you need anything, I'm around.

318
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,677
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

319
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,137
But thank you for...

320
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,389
That's okay. It's my job.

321
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,350
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

322
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,476
Okay.

323
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,811
Well, thanks for...

324
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,939
talking to me. [chuckles nervously]

325
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,941
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

326
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,903
I mean, I'm fine.

327
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,113
[Diana] You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

328
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,701
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

329
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,203
Really?

330
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,579
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

331
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,082
Who are they kidding, right?

332
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,583
- [laughing] So lame.
- Dorky.

333
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,085
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

334
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,462
That's, like, the lamest of lames.

335
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,317
[watch ticking]

336
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,698
[Diana and Barbara laughing]

337
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,285
Wow. You're so funny.

338
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,663
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

339
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,749
I mean, no one's made me laugh like this
in such a long time.

340
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,627
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

341
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,337
You don't get out much?

342
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:47,714
No, not really.

343
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,424
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

344
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,676
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

345
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,969
who's, like, always out.

346
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,304
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

347
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,515
and you live out. You're just out.

348
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,767
- [both laugh]
- Like, you never get in.

349
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,812
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

350
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,022
And I would know
because I've never been popular.

351
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,107
You haven't?

352
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,692
You're so personable.

353
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,153
So... free.

354
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,407
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

355
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,408
[laughing] What?

356
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,536
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

357
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,121
Oh, my gosh.

358
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,082
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

359
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,918
and talk behind my back
when they don't think I can hear them.

360
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,795
I'm like, "Guys, I can hear you."
[laughs nervously]

361
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,676
Barbara, my life

362
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,472
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

363
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,725
We all have our struggles.

364
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:41,934
Yeah, we do.

365
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,730
Have you ever been in love?

366
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,401
Uh... Yeah.

367
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,987
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

368
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,905
You?

369
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,407
So many times, yeah. All the time.

370
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,117
Often.

371
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,410
So what happened?

372
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,245
Where'd he go, your guy?

373
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,247
He, uh...

374
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,166
He died.

375
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:11,380
But I still think sometimes
that I see him up there in the sky.

376
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:12,799
He was a pilot.

377
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,052
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

378
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:19,555
but he was great. It was true.

379
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,642
I get it.

380
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,728
Well, cheers to us.

381
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,898
Wishing us better luck, I guess.

382
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,573
Hey, Leon.

383
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,158
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

384
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,660
Yeah. Going back to work.

385
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,537
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

386
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,748
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

387
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,250
Stay warm.

388
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,512
[drunk man] Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

389
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,888
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

390
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:02,932
'Cause, uh,

391
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,477
you know, you look as though
you're having a little bit of trouble

392
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:07,854
walking in those heels, huh?

393
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,188
It's okay.
I wear these heels all the time.

394
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,273
Hey, come on. Let me walk you home.

395
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,234
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

396
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,153
Huh? Come on.

397
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,157
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey!
- [yelping]

398
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,576
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

399
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,785
Let go of me!

400
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,620
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

401
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:27,081
[Barbara grunts] Let go!

402
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,459
[bin clattering]

403
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,258
- [drunk man groaning]
- [Barbara panting]

404
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,555
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

405
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,099
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

406
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,310
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

407
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,562
Honestly, it takes no power at all.

408
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,981
Are you okay?

409
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,609
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

410
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,943
- Thank you.
- Of course.

411
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,361
Go home, okay?

412
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,238
- Yeah.
- Good night.

413
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,738
I do know what I'd wish for.

414
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,826
To be like Diana.

415
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,706
- [wind whooshing]
- Strong, sexy,

416
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,750
cool.

417
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,964
Special.

418
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,104
[scoffs]

419
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,751
[watch ticking]

420
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,345
[door closes]

421
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,650
Oh...

422
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,740
[breathing heavily]

423
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,506
[grunts]

424
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,224
[janitor] Oh, no! Oh!

425
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,601
Sorry.

426
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,728
Oh, it's okay.

427
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,730
Barbara, thank God you're good in heels.

428
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,231
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

429
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,902
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

430
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,904
Wow. [chuckles] Looking good.

431
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,156
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

432
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:50,117
[Carol] This is our Earth Sciences lab.

433
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,869
Oh, Barbara!

434
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,245
Hi.

435
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,664
Perfect.

436
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,249
I have someone I would like you to meet.

437
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,835
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

438
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,296
[chuckles] Uh, it's "Doctor," actually.

439
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,007
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

440
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,093
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

441
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,638
Life is good, but it can be better.

442
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,181
- [gasps]
- [Carol laughing]

443
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,474
[Barbara] Oh, my gosh. From TV.

444
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,351
Oh, my gosh. You're the oil guy.

445
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,728
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

446
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,105
[all laughing]

447
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,148
Mr. Lord is considering

448
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,651
becoming a Friend of the Smithsonian
at the Partner level.

449
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,528
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

450
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,737
of private tours of our facilities,

451
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,531
and he asked for you by name.

452
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,992
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

453
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,911
Your reputation precedes you.

454
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,665
And apparently we share a passion
for gemology.

455
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,417
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

456
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,419
- Uh...
- [Maxwell chuckling]

457
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,922
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

458
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,757
and we'll go.

459
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,031
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

460
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,203
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

461
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,041
[Maxwell and Barbara laughing]

462
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,960
[Barbara] I love that ruby.

463
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,128
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

464
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,462
- [Maxwell] What?
- [Barbara] That's very...

465
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,756
- [Maxwell imitates monster growling]
- [both laughing]

466
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,426
[Barbara] Hey, have you seen my friend?
Where'd he go?

467
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,760
- [Maxwell] I'm right here.
- [Barbara] You are.

468
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,596
- [Maxwell laughing]
- Thank God.

469
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,763
Oh, wait.
You've got a little dust on you.

470
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,098
- Sorry.
- [Diana] Hey, good morning.

471
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,099
Oh, hi.

472
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,642
- Hi.
- [Barbara] Oh! Uh...

473
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,145
This is the one and only,

474
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,230
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

475
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,025
It's him.

476
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,611
Life is good,

477
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,197
but it can be better.

478
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,990
[both laughing]

479
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,658
He's from TV.

480
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,160
Oh, I don't have a TV.

481
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,870
Well, I have a great relationship
with Sears.

482
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,997
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

483
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,582
Nineteen inches.

484
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,210
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

485
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,753
But thank you.

486
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,754
Okay.

487
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,340
You're so generous. Um...

488
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,342
Headline... Uh...

489
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,343
Mr. Lord

490
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,971
took a tour of the entire Smithsonian

491
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,098
while considering partnership,

492
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,850
[giggles] and guess
what he decided to do?

493
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,353
Give his entire donation

494
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,687
to our department.

495
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,815
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

496
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,400
It's going to be an amazing party.

497
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,985
I hope you have something nice to wear.

498
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,030
I actually tend to skip these events.

499
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:36,825
I find that our benefactors
with a true eye towards philanthropy

500
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,702
prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

501
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,247
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

502
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,331
I agree.

503
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,707
Except,

504
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:47,169
- I like to party.
- [laughing]

505
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,297
Oh, my gosh. You're such a good dancer.

506
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,632
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

507
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,425
I know that I'm a terrible dancer.

508
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,010
No, I doubt
that you're a terrible dancer...

509
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,679
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

510
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:57,638
...the shape that you're in.

511
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:58,847
[Diana] Great, so,

512
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,600
- thank you so much for coming.
- [Barbara] Oh, yeah.

513
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,143
[Maxwell] You know,
I really should be going.

514
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,436
Thank you for the tour.

515
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,773
I will have to see you tonight.

516
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,900
See you tonight. [laughs]

517
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,820
Bye. Have a good day.

518
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,072
I'll find you.

519
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,743
What?

520
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,454
I like him.

521
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,123
[Barbara laughs]

522
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,299
[Maxwell] Thank you, John.

523
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,633
[Maxwell grunts]

524
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,262
[Maxwell chattering indistinctly
on recording]

525
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,930
Ladies.

526
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,974
Mr. Lord.

527
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:42,975
Mr. Lord.

528
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,060
Not now, Raquel. My supplements?

529
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,856
[Raquel] On your desk, but Mr. Lord.

530
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,442
Mr. Lord.

531
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,776
[elevator bell dings]

532
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,531
Mr. Lord.

533
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,493
[sighs]

534

[running footsteps approaching]

535
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,721
[Raquel] Mr. Lord.

536
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,891
[panting] Mr. Lord.

537
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:24,892
[Alistair] Dad!

538
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:25,976
[Maxwell] How?

539
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,562
How!

540
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,064
It's your weekend.

541
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,191
Yes, clearly.

542
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,777
Alistair. [chuckles]

543
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,487
Where's the pool, Daddy?

544
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,322
It's not done yet, buddy.

545
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,449
But it doesn't matter.

546
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,242
[sighs] You just have to be patient.

547
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,620
I told you the pool,

548
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,330
the helicopter,

549
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,124
you'll have it all.
But remember,

550
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,086
Rome wasn't built in a day, was it? No.

551
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,879
[Alistair] Hasn't it been a lot of days?

552
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:57,257
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

553
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,593
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

554
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,889
[Stagg] Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

[Maxwell hesitates]

558
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,981
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

- [Maxwell chuckles]
- It's over, Max.

560
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,153
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

561
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,571
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

562
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,572
Simon.

563
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,700
I know it's hard to see right now,

564
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,829
but we are finally right at the edge
of turning this thing around.

565
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,705
"Turning it around"?

566
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,000
There is no oil. There never was.

567
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,461
So how are you gonna turn it around?

568
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:37,297
[scoffs] Get more sucker investors,
like me?

569
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,049
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

570
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,468
I have a big... [sighs heavily]

571
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:43,095
There's something in the works.

572
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,639
And it's no scheme.

573
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:50,060
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

574
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,563
You have oil rights on land

575
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,690
that everyone else passed on already.

576
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,108
Now, it didn't take much digging

577
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,401
to find that out.

578
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:59,528
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

579
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,738
Maxwell Lorenzano.

580
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,867
Didn't take long to find out
you're nothing but a lowlife con man.

581
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,161
I am not a con man!

582
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,709
- I am a television personality.
- [groans]

583
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,169
And a respected businessman

584
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,837
- with a plan.
- Come on.

585
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,548
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

586
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,134
"If you can dream it, you can have it."

587
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,052
Something like that?

588
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,931
You have 48 hours

589

- You're going to regret this.

590
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,228
- ...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.
- [forced laughing]

591
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,314
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

592
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,774
Simon, wait.

593
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,362
[yells in frustration]

594
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,077
I am not a loser.

595
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,705
He's a loser!

596
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,626
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

597
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,086
He's a liar...

598
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,422
and he's wrong.

599
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,257
[sighs]

600
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,637
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

601
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,938
And you...

602
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,111
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

603
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,823
Okay.

604
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,413
You'll see.

605
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,626
Everyone will.

606
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,381

These are known for a terrific fit.

607
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:27,843
[Barbara] Yeah,
I'm just not so great with heels.

608
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,636
Just try them.

609
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,640
- Come out and show me.
- [Barbara sighs]

610
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,059
[Barbara] Okay. Hmm.

611
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,445
They do fit well.

612
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,571
Ah.

613
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:48,655
[Barbara] Huh.

614
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,162
- Yeah, I like it.
- [saleswoman] You look

615
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,663
amazing.

616
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,248
Do you think it's too tight?

617
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,542
I think it's just right.

618
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,628
- Wow.
- Yeah.

619
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,714
I'll take it.

Thank you.

I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

637
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,628
so I've probably worn this dress
a million times.

00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:27,713
Mmm.

Um...

Actually, no. [laughs nervously] I...

641
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,052
I just bought this today.

642

I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

Biotin.

00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,858
You should try it.

Uh, it's nothing special, really.

No need to be stumped ever again.

[Barbara breathing heavily]

675
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,447

go out of the museum.

Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:42,472
Yeah, that's right.
Interning, but requested by name, so...

682
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,350
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,508
Why did you say that?

690
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,261
Don't say that to me.

691
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,888
You don't even know me.

692
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,265
Yes, I do.

693
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,778
I can save today...

694
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,615
but you can save the world.

697
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,885
But how?

698
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:04,137
I don't know.

699
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,103
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

700
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:15,690
It's you.

701
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,120
I missed you.

[Diana] <i>So what do you remember?</i>

703
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,462
[Steve] I remember...

00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,172
I remember taking the plane up...

705

[Diana] Mmm-hmm.

706
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,384
...and then...

707
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,679
nothing, really.

708
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:46,888
Nothing.

709
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,933
But somehow,
I know I've been some place since then.

710
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,602
Some place that's, uh...

711
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,940
I can't really put words to it.

712
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:00,652
But it's... It's good.

713
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,994
And then I, uh... I woke up here.

714
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,995
Where?

715
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,664
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

716
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:17,919
Strange, strange pillow bed with slats.

717
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,713
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

718
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,089
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

719
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:26,052
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

720
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,346
if I'm being really honest with you.

721
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,765
I mean, for a futuristic time like this.
Nineteen...

722
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:34,477
Eighty-four. 1984.

723
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:36,354
[both sigh]

724
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,356
[airplane passing]

725
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,823
[Steve] That's amazing.

726
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,742
[Steve chuckles in astonishment]

727
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,836
[Diana laughing joyously]

728
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,716
[Steve] Would you like to see my futon?

729
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:14,601
- [kicks]
- [door closes]

730
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,311
- [objects clattering]
- [Diana gasps]

731
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,063
Yeah. Um...

732
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,274
You don't have to tell me.

733
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:25,153
The place is a mess. Cheese on demand.

734
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,698
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

735
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:31,367
but he seems to me to be an engineer.

736
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,621
Lots of pictures of himself.

737
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:39,417
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

738
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,545
Oh, so this is how you found me.

739
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:45,006
Yeah, the phone book.

740
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,592
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

741
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:48,760
So you went to my apartment?

742
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,428
Yeah, I tried to use the bike at first.

743
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:54,933
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

744
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:59,062
so I ran over and saw you come back.

745
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:04,192
And I was stunned.

746
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,362
There you were.

747
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,574
So I just, uh...

748
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,494
followed you, like a creep.

749
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,250
Diana, look at you. It's...

750
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:25,088
It's like not one day has passed.

751
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:27,799
I can't say the same thing about you.

752
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:32,804
[sighs] Right, right, right. Right.

753
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,813
Yeah, he's, uh...

754
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,966
He's got it.

755
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,677
[laughing] No, I like him.

756
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:18,433
He's great, but all I see is you.

757
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:42,749
"One great wish." I've been waiting.

758
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,007
I wish to be you.

759
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:53,718
The Dreamstone itself.

760
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,181
[wind whooshing]

761
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,141
[groaning]

762
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,657
[laughing]

763
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,000
[sighs]

764
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,143
[gasps]

765
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:53,778
Hi.

766
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,073
Come here.

767
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

768
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,162
[Diana hums happily]

769
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:08,251
Been eating Pop-Tarts all morning,
and I've had about three pots of coffee.

770
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:12,255
This place is amazing. [laughing]

771
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:15,174
- This place?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,593
You know, if I really think about it,

773
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,513
I don't think I've ever been in a room
more amazing.

774
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,391
- It's true.
- Yeah.

775
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,518
This room is the most amazing place

776
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,438
- I've ever been in, in my entire life.
- It's the most amazing place, right?

777
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:31,941
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

778
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,277
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

779
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:35,445
- Okay.
- Okay.

780
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,612
Let's just stay here.

781
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,197
Let's just stay here.

782
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,325
[Diana] Forever.

783
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,746
Although...

784
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,707
I should probably go and figure out

785
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:52,462
how a stone brought my boyfriend back
in someone else's body.

786
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,758
- [Steve breathing heavily]
- [Diana humming]

787
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,052
That's a fair point. Let's go.

788
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,950
[replaces barbell]

789
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,845
Whoa.

790
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,068
- [computer beeps]
- [knocking on door]

791
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,236
[Belinda] Mr. Stagg?

792
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,154
Thank you, Belinda.

793
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,073
Oh, God.

794
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,535
You'd better be here with my money.

795
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,704
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

796
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,249
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

797
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:12,333
I'm sorry.

798
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,378
I messed up. I messed up.

799
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,004
I lied.

800
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,715
And I'm sorry.

801
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,428
You know, the truth is, I knew
we were going to sink a long time ago.

802
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,721
The wells were coming up dry.

803
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,267
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

804
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:31,018
I should have folded then.

805
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,021
But all the people that bought in,
that believed in me.

806
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,524
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

807
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,484
Max, look, you don't have to...

808
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:42,238
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

809
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,116
That with every ounce of my being,

810
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:49,328
I wished that Black Gold
would change the world for all of us.

811
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,874
And I know you wished that, too.

812
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,585
- Of course I wished that, too.
- [wind whooshing]

813
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,424
Then your wish is granted.

814
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,135
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

815
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,389
and full control of Black Gold,

816
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,350
after you are somehow
magically removed from my path...

817
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,603
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

818
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,899
[Stagg] Max!

819
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,567
Hey, Max!

820
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,071
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

821
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,033
What the hell is going on?

822
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,202
[tires screeching]

823
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:34,790
We have a warrant for Simon Stagg.

824
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,459
My word. Are we in danger?

825
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,503
No, sir. Federal taxation crime.

826
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,254
It doesn't concern you. Move along.

827
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,340
[guard] Send them through.

828
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,634
- [man] Okay. Follow me.
- [agent] Let's go, guys.

829
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,061
[spraying]

830
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,938
[sniffing]

831
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:57,939
Ooh.

832
00:55:58,481 --> 00:55:59,732
- [continues spraying]
- [laughs]

833
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:04,070
So you said a stone started all of this?

834
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:06,447
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

835
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,616
I mean, it must have done something.

836
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,953
- This is dynamite.
- [Diana sighs]

837
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,120
What do you think?

838
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,665
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

839
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,459
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

840
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,920
I think we can do better.

841
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,506
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

842
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:24,966
There are pockets all over the pant.

843
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:28,553
American issue bag, adjustable.

844
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,388
Parachute pants?

845
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:33,182
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

846
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,392
<i>You know, I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

847
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,312
I figure you are, but you know what,
I'm ready to go.

848
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:39,397
[Diana] Mmm-mmm.

849
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,148
- Right?
- No.

850
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,443
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

851
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,113
"Too much" in a good way or a bad way?
Right?

852
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,781
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

853
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:52,118
Now that's great.

854
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:54,203
It's beautiful.

855
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,872
Yeah. I would absolutely never wear it.

856
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:58,583
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

857
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,127
Who would wear this?

858
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,587
Diana,

859
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,046
have you seen these shoes?

860
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,632
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

861
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:07,842
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

862
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,021
[Diana] This is a special one, okay?

863
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,189
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

864
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:26,444
One foot after the other.

865
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:28,279
Now stay on this one.

866
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,239
Go to the middle.

867
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:31,532
No, Steve...

868
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,243
- Steve, you're gonna fall.
- [yelps]

869
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,412
[Steve laughing]

870
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,501
I really thought I was gonna fall.

871
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,636
[indistinct chattering]

872
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,101
What's up?

873
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,562
[subway train approaching]

874
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,244
[hip-hop music playing on stereo]

875
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,208
This is break dance.

876
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:23,918
- [Steve] Dancing?
- [Diana] Yeah.

877
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:26,837
[Steve laughing]

878
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:30,383
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

879
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,842
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

880
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:32,927
It's nothing.

881
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,393
It's all art.

882
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,271
Yeah.

883
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,861
Uh... That's just a trash can.

884
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,780
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,411
Is that a plane?

886
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,997
Come on. I want to show you something.

887
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,836
[announcer chattering on PA]

888
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,007
[Diana chuckling]

889
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,267
[Steve gasps]

890
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:24,311
This is incredible! [laughing]

891
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,995
[Maxwell on recording]
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

892
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,330
<i>- you strike gold.</i>
- [phone ringing]

893
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:47,752
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

894
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,212
Raquel?

895
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,883
- Raquel?
- [phone continues ringing]

896
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,221
- [ringing]
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

897
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,098
[phones ringing continuously]

898
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:03,517
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

899
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,478
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

900
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,021
The wells struck pay!

901
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:08,564
- Which ones?
- All of them.

902
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:10,357
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

903
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,068
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

904
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,196
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

905
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,156
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

906
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,742
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

907
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,371
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

908
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,248
- Yes, I wish I had more help.
- [wind whooshing]

909
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:27,792
There are just too many calls to take.

910
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,376
[Emerson] Uh... Hi.

911
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,836
I'm sorry to bother you.

912
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,880
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

913
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,089
- You're hired!
- [Emerson] Oh...

914
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:35,466
Welcome aboard!

915
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,176
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

916
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,803
Is this the employment office?

917
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,137
Yes! You're hired, too!

918
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:43,724
Mr. Lord, it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

919
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:46,852
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

920
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:50,397
I'll take it in my office.

921
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,068
And bring me my vitamins.

922
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,196
So I did read
about four books last night...

923
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,113
[all laughing]

924
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,199
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

925
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:01,951
This is from the Song Dynasty.

926
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,077
You were correct.

927
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:04,286
And also interesting,

928
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,747
I was looking at a couple
of encyclopedias last night and you...

929
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,375
Thanks. Um...

930
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,377
[laughs]

931
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,005
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

932
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,507
[all laughing]

933
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,634
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

934
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:19,844
- Hi.
- [Diana] Good morning.

935
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:23,055
This is Steve. He's my, um...

936
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:24,223
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

937
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,767
Hi, old friend Steve. [laughs]

938
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,811
I'm Barbara, Diana's new friend.

939
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:30,312
So what do you do?

940
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,480
I'm a pilot.

941
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,732
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

942
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,025
Sure.

943
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:41,574
So, I just wanted to speak to you
about that stone.

944
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,825
The citrine one.

945
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,201
[hesitating]

946
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,036
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

947
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,498
Long story, actually, about that.

948
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,877
Max Lord came by to visit yesterday.

949
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,254
Which was actually pretty great.

950
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:57,172
I'll tell you about it later. Um...

951
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,800
I let him

952
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:01,343
borrow it.

953
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,636
What? Why?

954
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:03,888
Well, Diana,

955
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,264
he just gave us a huge amount of money.

956
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,308
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

957
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,059
Plus he has a friend who's an expert,
and I don't know...

958
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,061
What do you mean? How could you loan it?

959
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,897
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

960
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,190
What are you getting on my case for?

961
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:18,694
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

962
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,487
Do you know where he took it?

963
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,197
No, I have no idea.

964
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,825
Then I'll tell you what we find out.

965
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:26,285
Let's go.

966
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:28,370
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

967
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,413
Yeah. Call me.

968
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,207
Or not. Whatever.

969
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,501
But I'd be curious.

970
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,965
[police siren wails]

971
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:43,427
[man on PA] <i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

972
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,971
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

973
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,643
What are these people doing?

974
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,019
Whatever it is,

975
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,938
we're not getting in that way.

976
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,984
Diana. Diana, this way.

977
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,453
Have at it.

978
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:18,420
[grunts]

979
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,302
Strong lock.

980
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,309
- [phones ringing continuously]
- [people chattering]

981
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,443
[whispers] Steve.

982
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,459
[Diana blowing]

983
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,546
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

984
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,799
It's like a bomb went off.

985
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,355
[Steve] Whatever this is, he's been
looking for it for a long time.

986
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:34,496
[Diana] "Place upon the object held."

987
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,498
[gasps]

988
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:38,751
What is it?

989
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,087
[breathing heavily]
The language of the Gods.

990
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,840
Which God wrote it, is the question.

991
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:49,094
- [phone ringing]
- Thanks.

992
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,846
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

993
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,098
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

994
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,350
- Hello?
- [Diana] <i>Barbara, I need your help.</i>

995
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,603
<i>I need you to find out</i>

996
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,355
exactly where that stone was found.

997
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,608
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

998
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,777
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.</i>

999
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,528
Thanks.

1000
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,866
You look like you saw a ghost.

1001
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,161
I did.

1002
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,666
There were many Gods

1003
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,336
and they did different things
for different reasons.

1004
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,506
One was making objects like this.

1005
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,926
There are universal elements
in this world,

1006
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,970
and when they're imbued into something,

1007
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:36,308
they can become very, very powerful.

1008
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,311
Like my Lasso of Truth.

1009
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:41,688
The truth is what powers it, not me.

1010
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,733
The truth is bigger than all of us.

1011
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,652
But what is this?

1012
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,905
I don't know. Uh...

1013
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,575
Brought me back.

1014
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:59,039
Love or hope...

1015
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,542
maybe?

1016
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,544
[Diana] Maybe.

1017
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:09,967
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

1018
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,510
We need to find this guy.

1019
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,804
Uh...

1020
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,313
Look at this.

1021
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,607
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

1022
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:27,609
Cairo?

1023
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:32,030
[Steve] Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

1024
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,949
[Diana] "King of Crude"?

1025
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,535
How is this so fast?

1026
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,122
You have a plane that can fly

1027
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:41,623
from here to Cairo in one shot?

1028
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,708
That is amazing. [laughs]

1029
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:46,211
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

1030
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,838
I don't want to get on one,

1031
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,631
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

1032
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,133
I want to fly this plane.

1033
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,385
Yeah?

1034
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,401
- [keypad buzzes]
- [doors unlock]

1035
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,163
[Steve] Oh, my Betsy.

1036
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,128
[Diana] Hey, Steve, this way.

1037
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,922
Yeah.

1038
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:32,966
Look at these gams.

1039
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,718
[Steve gasping]

1040
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,228
You wanna choose?

1041
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:48,315
This one.

1042
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,484
[Diana] I like it.

1043
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,495
[Steve grunts]

1044
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:02,955
Okay.

1045
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,752
Okay. Uh...

1046
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:11,213
No.

1047
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:12,923
Uh...

1048
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,591
[Steve laughs]

1049
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:15,968
All right. Good, good.

1050
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,136
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

1051
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,304
Here we go. Engine.

1052
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,848
[engine starting]

1053
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,100
Here goes nothing.

1054
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,729
Oh...

1055
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:29,648
[Steve laughing in delight]

1056
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:38,991
[beeping]

1057
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:40,826
- Ken?
- [Ken] What?

1058
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:42,452
There's an aircraft on the runway.

1059
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,162
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

1060
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:45,163
Approach, this is Tower.

1061
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:46,915
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

1062
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,208
Are you seeing this?

1063
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:52,254
[siren wailing]

1064
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,172
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,674
I just have to pick up speed first,

1066
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:57,426
and then I'll take off.

1067
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,387
The way I fly, they will never find us.

1068
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,306
[soldiers shouting]

1069
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,893
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

1070
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,270
Radar. I can't explain now,

1071
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,564
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

1072
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,358
Well, will they shoot at us?

1073
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,695
- Well, shit, Diana.
- [mouthing] Right.

1074
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,238
[sirens wailing]

1075
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:25,495
- [mouthing] Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

1076
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,582
I know. [exhales deeply] Focus.

1077
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,667
Focus.

1078
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,961
My father hid Themyscira from the world,

1079
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:35,005
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

1080
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,256
Did what?

1081
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,300
Made something invisible.

1082
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:40,552
But in 50 years, I've only done it once.

1083
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,220
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

1084
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,306
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

1085
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:46,892
It was just a coffee cup...

1086
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:48,560
and I lost it.

1087
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:58,612
[shouting]

1088
01:09:58,737 --> 01:09:59,905
[breathing deeply]

1089
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,912
[yelling]

1090
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,212
[air traffic controller] Approach,

1091
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:16,421
the aircraft has vanished.

1092
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:17,589
Do you have eyes on it?

1093
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,805
[Diana laughing]

1094
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:28,934
[Steve exhales deeply]

1095
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,161
An invisible jet.

1096
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,499
[Steve laughing]

1097
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:11,393
[muffled bursting]

1098
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,811
What's that?

1099
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:16,148
[Diana] Oh, it's okay.

1100
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,816
It's just fireworks.

1101
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,861
The Fourth. Of course.

1102
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:22,446
The Fourth of July?

1103
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,070
Wow.

1104
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,741
[Diana laughs]

1105
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,250
I got an idea.

1106
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,883
[Diana exhales]

1107
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:26,968
[both laughing]

1108
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:47,864
[breathing heavily]

1109
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,955
You know, it's the one thing.

1110
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,749
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

1111
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:58,750
What?

1112
01:12:58,917 --> 01:12:59,918
Flight.

1113
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,586
Your gift.

1114
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,214
I'll never understand it.

1115
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,508
Ah, it's...

1116
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:10,220
It's so easy, really.

1117
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:12,639
It's wind and air

1118
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:17,477
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

1119
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,522
How to join with it.

1120
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:23,650
Yeah.

1121
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:26,194
It's like anything, really.

1122
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,304
[agent] Great, thanks.

1123
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,098
Found the last one.

1124
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,018
This should keep you busy for a while.

1125
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:03,189
Anything else I can get you? Coffee?

1126
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,191
Tea?

1127
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,235
Me?

1128
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,531
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

1129
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:13,283
You're done?

1130
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,369
Hey, you don't have to be mean about it.

1131
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,462
[man] Hey, babe. Where you going?

1132
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:27,130
[panting] No thanks.

1133
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,136
Ooh, you're pretty.

1134
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,263
Hey, slow down, sexy.

1135
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,811
You talking to me?

1136
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,855
Yep. I'm talking to you.

1137
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,401
Why don't you just slow down a bit, huh?

1138
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:50,528
Come on, girl.

1139
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:53,198
I'd rather not. You know what I mean?

1140
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:58,078
I'd rather not have anything to do
with someone like you.

1141
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,622
I'd rather you stop harassing people.

1142
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,833
Like me.

1143
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:05,752
Do you remember me?

1144
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,798
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1145
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,593
I remember. Where were we, huh?

1146
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:17,681
No.

1147
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,936
No.

1148
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:24,938
[breathing heavily]

1149
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:27,649
[groaning]

1150
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:30,485
[drunk man] No.

1151
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:33,947
[Barbara] She's right.

1152
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:36,324
It's not that hard.

1153
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,534
[Barbara grunts]

1154
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:44,541
Yeah, I think I get it now.

1155
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,836
His body weight does do all the work.

1156
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,591
So easy.

1157
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:56,928
I think

1158
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,596
I could do this...

1159
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,473
[whimpering]

1160
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,184
- All...
- [groaning]

1161
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:05,895
night...

1162
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,357
long!

1163
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,569
[continues groaning]

1164
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,418
[Leon] Barbara?

1165
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,715
What are you doing?

1166
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,470
Mind your business.

1167
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,604
Sir?

1168
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:59,491
[Emir] Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

1169
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:03,787
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1170
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:06,539
[Maxwell] To meet a peer.

1171
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:08,249
[Emir] A peer?

1172
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:12,170
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed
to meet with you because I was curious.

1173
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,298
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1174
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,888
On my journey to self-fulfillment...

1175
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,349
I lucked into a secret.

1176
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:26,434
[whispering] The secret of the wish.

1177
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:28,603
So I wished for it.

1178
01:17:28,812 --> 01:17:32,023
Or someone wished for it for me.

1179
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,027
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

1180
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,571
and I will show you how it works.

1181
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,700
I wish for things one cannot attain.

1182
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,285
Like what?

1183
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,706
All of my land to be returned.

1184
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,583
My ancestral realm.

1185
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,710
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1186
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:56,047
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1187
01:17:56,256 --> 01:18:01,135
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

1188
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,221
You wish for that?

1189
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:06,182
I wish for that deeply.

1190
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:08,226
[wind whooshing]

1191
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:13,356
Your wish is granted.

1192
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:17,068
And in return, I will take your oil.

1193
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,987
[Emir laughing]

1194
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:25,285
You truly delight me.

1195
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,662
You know so little.

1196
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:31,040
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1197
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,500
You are a silly man.

1198
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,085
[continues laughing]

1199
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:38,172
[all laughing]

1200
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,261
Then I will take your security team

1201
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:45,179
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1202
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:48,308
against the wrath you most
certainly will face. [snaps fingers]

What are you doing?

1210
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,396
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1211
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,649
I command you to stop!

1212
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,651
Stop!

[Maxwell laughs]

1249
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,388

Hello?

01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,411
Barbara, it's Diana.

01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,956

1290
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:38,379
From where?

1291
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:39,880
That's the weird thing.

1292
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:41,590
From everywhere.

1293
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:45,219
It first appeared in the Indus Valley
almost 4,000 years ago.

1294
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,888
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1295
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,890
Kush, 4 AD.

1296
01:27:50,141 --> 01:27:52,059
Romulus, the last Emperor of Rome,

1297
01:27:52,226 --> 01:27:54,937
he had it on him
when he was assassinated in 476.

1298
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:59,108
<i>The last record is
in some previously unknown dead city</i>

1299

<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

1300
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,486
- The Mayans.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1301
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,738
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

1302
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:08,367
and my last lead is not that promising.

1303
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:09,660
What's that?

1304
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,412
<i>A flyer I found.</i>

1305
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:12,872
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1306
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,459
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1307
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,920
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1308
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:22,631
- And he knows about the stone?
<i>- So he says.</i>

1309
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:24,967
I'm gonna go there in the morning.

1310
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:28,554
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1311
01:28:31,474 --> 01:28:33,184
[Steve] What is it?

1312
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:36,604
The stone has traveled the world

1313
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,439
to seemingly random
and different places,

1314
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:40,941
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1315
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,944
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1316
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,821
Without a trace as to why.

1317
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:48,115
You don't think the stone could have...

1318
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,326
Do you?

1319
01:28:50,493 --> 01:28:52,453
I don't know what to think, Steve.

1320
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:56,290
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1321
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:03,088
[wind howling]

1322
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:24,026
[Babajide coughing]

1323
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,237
Babajide?

1324
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,494
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1325
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,081
Hello.

1326
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,376
One second.

1327
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:42,336
[Babajide sighs]

1328
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:44,380
- So you're a Mayan?
- [Babajide humming]

1329
01:29:45,673 --> 01:29:47,424
What? I'm a citizen of the world.

1330
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:48,717
It says your name is Frank.

1331
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:52,096
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1332
01:29:52,263 --> 01:29:53,305
So that's a no.

1333
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:55,391
[Babajide] But to answer
your question, yes.

1334
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:58,852
My great-great-grandfather

1335
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:00,563
left me this.

1336
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,983
I don't know everything about it,
but I have been warned

1337
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:05,651
I'm better off that way.

1338
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:09,196
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

1339
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:10,739
in a matter of months.

1340
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,992
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

1341
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:16,495
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1342
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,206
- [Diana] Can I see that?
- [Babajide] Be my guest.

1343
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,136
[Diana gasps]

1344
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:34,972
[Steve] What?

1345
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:36,724
What is it?

1346
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,479
[Diana] <i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

1347
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,647
[Steve] What's that?

1348
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,066
A very bad God.

1349
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:48,444
The God of Lies, Dolos, Mendacius,

1350
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,113
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1351
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,490
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

1352
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:54,950
there has to be a trick.

1353
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:56,994
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1354
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:59,288
It seems more like a Dreamstone to me.

1355
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:03,042
Wishes with a trick.

1356
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,544
"The Monkey's Paw."

1357
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:06,920
Beware what you wish for.

1358
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:10,674
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

1359
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,053
Diana, your powers.

1360
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,638
[Barbara] No, that doesn't
make any sense.

1361
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,514
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1362
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:18,807
How do we stop this?

1363
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,184
[Babajide] The legend said

1364
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:21,894
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1365
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,480
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1366
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:26,023
and refused to do the second.

1367
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,984
Now the culture's destroyed.

1368
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:30,778
Wiped from the face of the Earth.

1369
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,906
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1370
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:35,699
What? When?

1371
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,162
[whispers] "You're looking at it."

1372
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:43,707
"You're looking at it."
That's what Max Lord said to me.

1373
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:45,959
Maybe it's him.

1374
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,003
He's become it somehow.

1375
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,922
[Steve] But how would that happen?

1376
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,299
I mean, if he wished for...

1377
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:03,811
No, that's crazy. No.

1378
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:06,063
[Steve] If we destroy it,

1379
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,107
if we destroy him...

1380
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:10,359
all the wishes go back.

1381
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:12,194
[Barbara] What are you
talking about? No.

1382
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:14,154
I'm not gonna be a part of that. No.

1383
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:16,115
Or if everyone renounces their wish.

1384
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:19,326
[Barbara] No, there has to be
a better way.

1385
01:32:19,493 --> 01:32:20,828
No.

1386
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,833
She's right.

1387
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:28,252
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1388
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:31,213
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1389
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,925
Stopping him might not be enough, Diana.

1390
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:36,510
Wishes have been made.

1391
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,097
Barbara?

1392
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,975
Barbara?

1393
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:47,229
[indistinct chattering]

1394
01:32:51,442 --> 01:32:53,819
[Maxwell] Like I want any of these
people in the club anyway.

1395
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:55,362
Can we tell them they're not invited?

1396
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:56,363
No, sir.

1397
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,532
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

1398
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:02,494
The BBB, the FBD.

1399
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:05,414
It's a conspiracy against my success.

1400
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:07,583
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1401
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,210
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

1402
01:33:10,377 --> 01:33:12,129
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1403
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:15,299
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1404
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:16,884
And you have Alistair for the night.

1405
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:20,095
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1406
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,180
What? What? When?

1407
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:22,681
Tonight?

1408
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:28,854
[Emerson] He's here already.

1409
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,481
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1410
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:33,066
[Maxwell sighs heavily]

1411
01:33:36,195 --> 01:33:38,405
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1412
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:41,408
And buy Alistair a pony.

1413
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,786
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1414
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:47,956
Let's get to it, Lai.

1415
01:33:48,499 --> 01:33:50,042
Tell me...

1416
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:52,294
what do you want?

1417
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:56,215
What do you wish for?

1418
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,634
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1419
01:33:58,759 --> 01:33:59,927
Mmm-hmm.

1420
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:03,388
The Soviets have sided with Iran.

1421
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:06,934
Iraq is preparing to defend ourselves,
as unrest spreads.

1422
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,353
And you need? What do you...

1423
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:12,022
What do you wish for?

1424
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:14,399
Consider the sex tape gone.

1425
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,527
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

1426
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,488
one by one, by one, by one...

1427
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:21,114
- How's your health?
- Well...

1428
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:22,032
Forget that.

1429
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:25,994
But I will take your entire congregation
and your time slot.

1430
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:26,954
Let me ask you,

1431
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:29,164
when they pray, is there any way

1432
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:32,042
I could get all of them to...

1433
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:33,877
join hands with me?

1434
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,671
And simply say, "I wish"

1435
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:37,756
rather than, "I pray"?

1436
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:38,966
Would that even work?

1437
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,175
I don't...

1438
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:41,635
I need to find a way

1439
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,638
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1440
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:45,806
[knocking on door]

1441
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,724
Sir. The police are here.

1442
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,018
They're challenging the jurisdiction
of your security team.

1443
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:51,770
[Maxwell] Oh, God! [bangs table]

1444
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:55,190
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1445
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:56,525
And my son.

1446
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,610
You, beat it.

1447
01:34:58,694 --> 01:35:00,529
[Maxwell coughing]

1448
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:05,993
- [clearing throat]
- [knocking on door]

1449
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:09,913
Alistair!

1450
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:11,081
[door closes]

1451
01:35:11,999 --> 01:35:14,459
I've missed you, buddy.

1452
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:16,211
Come. Sit down with Daddy. I'm sorry.

1453
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:23,176
But, your dad is
on the absolute precipice of everything.

1454
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,470
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1455
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,431
Do you remember? Your dad?

1456
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,641
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

1457
01:35:29,892 --> 01:35:31,685
I know it's hard. I know.

1458
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:33,103
But listen,

1459
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,689
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

1460
01:35:35,856 --> 01:35:37,900
Do you hear that? I wish for it, too.

1461
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,151
I just wish I could be with you...

1462
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,819
No!

1463
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:45,198
You don't use
your one wish like that, Alistair.

1464
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,201
You don't wish for
something that you already have.

1465
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:50,871
You wish for greatness, for success.

1466
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,956
That's why I'm doing all of this.

1467
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:58,003
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1468
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,634
Then I wish for your greatness.

1469
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,594
- [wind whooshing]
- No. No!

1470
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,983
Thank you.

1471
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:22,778
I love you so much.

1472
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:28,033
And I promise you, one day,
everything is going to make sense.

1473
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,911
And one day, you'll thank me.

1474
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:35,332
But right now, I, uh...

1475
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:38,460
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

1476
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:40,712
You stay here.

1477
01:36:43,966 --> 01:36:45,133
[door closes]

1478
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:49,805
[indistinct chattering]

1479
01:36:51,765 --> 01:36:53,141
You. You.

1480
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,184
Yes, sir?

1481
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:57,104
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1482
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,105
Of course I do.

1483
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,607
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

1484
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:03,276
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1485
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,529
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1486
01:37:05,696 --> 01:37:06,947
What is it with you aides and Porsches?

1487
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:08,573
You!

1488
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:09,908
Hi.

1489
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,369
- This way.
- [crowd clamoring]

1490
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,291
How's traffic?

1491
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:20,002
Huh? Terrible.

1492
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,378
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1493
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:24,840
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1494
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:29,011
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1495
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:38,311
[officer] Hey, you! Stop!

1496
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:40,731
Come on in. It's not safe.

1497
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,858
There's a riot at the Saudi Embassy

1498
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:45,402
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1499
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:46,486
Come on. It's mad.

1500
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:49,614
- But my cows.
- [cows mooing]

1501
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:53,285
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1502
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:55,704
I didn't mean here.

1503
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:02,502
I'll be right back.

1504
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:14,473
[sirens wailing in distance]

1505
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,534
[watch ticking]

1506
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:03,313
- Diana, I know it's been hard.
- [scoffs]

1507
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,565
You don't know. You don't.

1508
01:39:05,732 --> 01:39:07,609
But we...

1509
01:39:07,776 --> 01:39:09,194
It can't go on like this.

1510
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:11,404
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1511
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,031
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1512
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,206
I give everything I have, every day.

1513
01:39:21,373 --> 01:39:23,208
And I'm happy to.

1514
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,585
But this one thing...

1515
01:39:26,962 --> 01:39:31,049
You're all that I've wanted for so long.

1516
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:35,095
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1517
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:37,639
I am so sorry...

1518
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:42,435
but that's crazy. [hesitates]

1519
01:39:42,686 --> 01:39:45,856
There's a world out there full of

1520
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:47,816
so many better guys, for one.

1521
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:50,193
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

1522
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,988
I don't want him. I want you.

1523
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:56,283
Why, for once,
can't I just have this one thing, Steve?

1524
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,993
This one thing.

1525
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,290
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1526
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:08,044
Well, I do have a choice.

1527
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,671
And I can't give you up. I can't.

1528
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:12,048
So I won't. So we need to stop him

1529
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,342
so we can figure that out.

1530
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:15,635
There has to be another way.

1531
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,638
Has to.

1532
01:40:26,897 --> 01:40:28,356
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1533
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:32,819
Wow.

1534
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,781
This is incredible.

1535
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,871
What's that?

1536
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,249
From my culture.

1537
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:50,378
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1538
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,423
It's huge. This whole thing?

1539
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:56,927
What is it made out of?

1540
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:58,803
Here. Let me show you.

1541
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:01,014
Give me your hand.

1542
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,350
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1543
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,936
The Lasso does more
than just make you tell the truth.

1544
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:08,063
It can make you see it, too.

1545
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:11,733
[sighs]

1546
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:15,695
[Diana] <i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

1547
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:17,864
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

1548
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:22,244
<i>When mankind enslaved the Amazons,
my mother freed us.</i>

1549
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:25,372
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

1550
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:28,625
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

1551
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:30,627
<i>My people gave up all of their armor</i>

1552
01:41:30,794 --> 01:41:35,215
<i>to make her one suit strong enough
to take on the whole world.</i>

1553
01:41:36,258 --> 01:41:41,304
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

1554
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:44,432
[breathing heavily]

1555
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,643
[Steve] That's...

1556
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:49,729
That's incredible.

1557
01:41:49,896 --> 01:41:52,857
When I came here, I searched for her.

1558
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:56,236
But all I could find was her armor.

1559
01:41:56,403 --> 01:41:57,862
What is this?

1560
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:00,907
[Steve] Where is he going?

1561
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:02,367
[Diana] Oh, no.

1562
01:42:22,304 --> 01:42:23,638
Diana, Diana! What are you doing?

1563
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,598
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1564
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:27,684
No. No. Listen to me.

1565
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:29,102
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1566
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:30,437
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1567
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:32,647
You might. We don't know that.

1568
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:35,775
There has to be another way in.

1569
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,332
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1570
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:51,833
Yes.

1571
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:55,253
Something very strange. I...

1572
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,715
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1573
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:02,886
Anyway. Hectic times.

1574
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:06,431
Give us a minute.

1575
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:13,229
[Diana] Excuse me.

1576
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:18,443
- Carl.
- Diana.

1577
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,320
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1578
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:22,489
Good to see you. How have you been?

1579
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:23,907
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1580
01:43:24,074 --> 01:43:25,533
Steve, this is Carl. My colleague.

1581
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,494
- Hi.
- Hi.

1582
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:29,371
Shall we, uh...

1583
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:31,956
Yeah, we shall.

1584
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:33,625
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1585
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,960
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1586
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:37,295
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1587
01:43:37,462 --> 01:43:41,174
These hectic days, hectic times.

1588
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:43,426
And you.

1589
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,095
[Carl] <i>These aren't exactly my favorite</i>

1590
01:43:45,261 --> 01:43:46,721
of the busts on display here,

1591
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:50,433
but it's a little picture of my top ten,
maybe top five at a push.

1592
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,811
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1593
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:57,607
These are floor tiles originally laid
by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1594
01:43:57,774 --> 01:43:59,526
a little-known descendent of Abraham.

1595
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:02,779
You're having some troubles?

1596
01:44:02,946 --> 01:44:04,280
Everywhere suddenly.

1597
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,199
Cuba, Egypt,

1598
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:07,784
even here.

1599
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:09,661
But Russia...

1600
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:12,080
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1601
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:15,542
I appreciate your concern,

1602
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,710
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1603
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:20,046
It's not money I'm offering.

1604
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:21,673
You.

1605
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:24,384
You are a man of faith,

1606
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:27,554
and I have been very blessed lately.

1607
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:33,643
I want to share my blessing with you.

1608
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:37,272
The power of positive thinking.

1609
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:42,152
Now...

1610
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:46,990
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

1611
01:44:47,157 --> 01:44:50,368
And you're not speaking to me here,
but to the universe.

1612
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:52,745
What do you wish for?

1613
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:57,917
- What is there to wish for but more?
- [wind whooshing]

1614
01:44:58,084 --> 01:44:59,878
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1615
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:01,754
Closer to 'em.

1616
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:03,631
If I just had that in place,

1617
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:06,050
then they would have to listen to us.

1618
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:09,220
[laughing] A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1619
01:45:09,304 --> 01:45:10,805
[groaning]

1620
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:13,433
Oh... Oh, my...

1621
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:14,934
[Maxwell continues groaning]

1622
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,313
[breathing heavily]

1623
01:45:18,438 --> 01:45:20,607
And you know what I'd like?

1624
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:25,904
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

1625
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,363
All the respect you command

1626
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:31,618
and the command everyone must respect.

1627
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,454
[Maxwell groaning]

1628
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:37,415
[laughing]

1629
01:45:37,499 --> 01:45:39,334
I mean, what else is there?

1630
01:45:40,627 --> 01:45:43,338
Now, tell your people I would appreciate

1631
01:45:43,505 --> 01:45:47,008
absolutely no interference whatsoever.

1632
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,594
No taxes, no rule of law, no limits.

1633
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:54,098
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1634
01:45:55,517 --> 01:45:56,643
Very good, sir.

1635
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:57,936
Right away.

1636
01:46:05,652 --> 01:46:06,528
What's this?

1637
01:46:06,694 --> 01:46:08,154
[POTUS] Global Broadcast Satellite.

1638
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:09,781
Top-secret program that enables us

1639
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:12,075
to override any broadcast system
in the world

1640
01:46:12,242 --> 01:46:15,703
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1641
01:46:15,954 --> 01:46:16,996
So what does that mean?

1642
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:19,249
You're taking over everyone's TVs?

1643
01:46:19,499 --> 01:46:20,416
How?

1644
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,335
[POTUS] It uses
particle beam technology,

1645
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:23,962
just like the Star Wars program.

1646
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,632
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1647
01:46:27,799 --> 01:46:29,634
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1648
01:46:30,677 --> 01:46:33,304
New or old. Broadcast whatever you want.

1649
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:34,889
Very impressive.

1650
01:46:35,056 --> 01:46:38,476
You said "touches"?

1651
01:46:39,769 --> 01:46:42,605
As in the particles you are sending...

1652
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:49,904
are touching everything?

1653
01:46:50,113 --> 01:46:51,364
[POTUS] It's a figure of speech,

1654
01:46:51,531 --> 01:46:52,699
but yes.

1655
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,659
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1656
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:57,245
to this satellite. And a chopper

1657
01:46:57,412 --> 01:46:58,246
to get me there.

1658
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,330
-Yes, sir. Right away. [snaps fingers]

1659
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:05,128
[grunts]

1660
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:12,635
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1661
01:47:12,802 --> 01:47:15,930
Come with me
before you do any more damage, Max.

1662
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,640
No. I don't think so.

1663
01:47:17,724 --> 01:47:18,725
Remove this woman, please...

1664
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:21,144
- permanently.
- [Wonder Woman grunts]

1665

[both groan]

1667
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:32,322
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1668
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:36,659
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1669
01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:38,911
- It's not their fault.
- [Steve panting]

1670
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:40,622

[groans]

1675
01:48:27,085 --> 01:48:28,252
That's neat.

1676
01:48:48,398 --> 01:48:49,857
[whimpering]

1677

[both groaning]

1678
01:49:01,703 --> 01:49:03,204
Barbara.

1679
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:08,167
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1680
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:29,522
[Wonder Woman groaning]

1681
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:36,654
[Steve grunting]

1682
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:41,784
Barbara. What...

1683
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:44,245
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1684
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:47,457
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1685
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,337
Turns out wishing to be like you...

1686
01:49:54,714 --> 01:49:56,632
came with some surprises.

1687
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:01,095
[guard 1 ] Hands up.

1688
01:50:01,262 --> 01:50:02,513
- Hands up.
- [guard 1 ] Hands up, hands up.

1689
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:03,806
[guard 2] Hands up!

1690
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:05,808
- Hands up!
- [guard 1 ] Now! Now, now!

1691
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:11,689
[all grunting]

1692
01:50:16,611 --> 01:50:17,695
[guard 3 screaming]

[groans]

1697
01:50:35,755 --> 01:50:38,925
Oh, how sweet, defending your love. Huh?

1698
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:41,677
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1699
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:42,720
No.

1700
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:45,598
Just not to be handcuffed to you,
but now I am.

1701
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:51,771
[both grunting]

1702
01:50:53,481 --> 01:50:54,649

[Wonder Woman] Barbara, stop!

01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:11,999
Ahh!

1710
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:20,758
Listen.

1711
01:51:20,925 --> 01:51:21,968
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1712
01:51:22,051 --> 01:51:23,010
I'm not what you think.

1713
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,595
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1714
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:26,931
Oh, I can't possibly understand?

1715
01:51:27,056 --> 01:51:28,182
[both grunting]

1716
01:51:30,476 --> 01:51:31,477
Oh...

Dumb little old me.

1718
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:34,897
Dumb little, poor little

nothing, nobody me.

1720
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:38,568
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1721
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:41,195
No, Barbara. That's not what I'm saying.

1722
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:49,787
Well, I'm handling it beautifully.

1723
01:51:50,246 --> 01:51:51,789
And I'm not giving it back!

01:52:16,147 --> 01:52:16,981
Go.

1728
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,025
Run!

1729
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:21,444
Everyone, stand down.

1730
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:24,363
Nobody hurts her.

1731
01:52:26,115 --> 01:52:27,783
They couldn't if they tried.

[groaning]

1734
01:52:32,747 --> 01:52:34,665
[Barbara] You've always had everything,

1735
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:37,501
while people like me have had nothing.

1736
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:42,214
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1737
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:45,718
But what is it costing you?

1738
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,303
What is it costing me?

1739
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:50,556
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

1740
01:52:52,767 --> 01:52:54,810
Yes, you're strong...

1741
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:58,022
but what did you lose, Barbara?

1742
01:52:58,898 --> 01:53:02,276
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1743
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:03,945
your humanity?

1744
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:07,823
You're attacking innocent men, Barbara.
Look at yourself.

1745
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,867
Forget about me.

1746
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:12,119
What is it costing you?

1747
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:19,710
Yeah, yeah.

1748
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:21,629
That's right.

1749
01:53:22,505 --> 01:53:24,465
Get used to it.

1750
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:29,553
If you go after Max Lord...

1751
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:32,306
or hurt him in any way,

1752
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,266
I will destroy you.

1753
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:35,434

<i>Sir, you need to wait.</i>

- [aide] We need to see the President.

1764
01:54:30,448 --> 01:54:31,824
He needs to be told.

1765
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:33,826
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1766
01:54:33,993 --> 01:54:36,787
The Soviets' early detection system
picked up our new nukes.

1767
01:54:37,204 --> 01:54:38,080
[White House staffer] <i>What new nukes?</i>

[CJCS] <i>A hundred warheads

You can have it all!

2017
02:13:42,807 --> 02:13:46,853
You just have to want it!

2018
02:13:49,105 --> 02:13:52,192
I've never wanted anything more.

2019
02:13:58,198 --> 02:14:00,450
But he's gone...

2020
02:14:01,284 --> 02:14:03,703
and that's the truth.

2021
02:14:04,454 --> 02:14:06,664
And everything has a price.

This world was a beautiful place

and you cannot have it all.

2026
02:14:27,393 --> 02:14:30,230
You can only have the truth.

2027
02:14:31,022 --> 02:14:33,942
And the truth is enough.

2028
02:14:34,108 --> 02:14:36,277
The truth is beautiful.

2029
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,449
So look at this world...

2030
02:14:43,034 --> 02:14:46,621
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

2031
02:14:47,497 --> 02:14:50,708
You must be the hero.

2032
02:14:51,501 --> 02:14:54,796
Only you can save the day.

2033

2035
02:15:01,636 --> 02:15:04,013
Why would I...

2036
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:07,725
when it's finally my turn?

2037
02:15:09,394 --> 02:15:12,897
The world belongs to me!

2038

You can't stop me. No one can!

2039

loser guy.

2128
02:21:30,816 --> 02:21:33,444
And I made terrible mistakes.

2129
02:21:34,403 --> 02:21:36,030
But you...

2130
02:21:38,282 --> 02:21:41,702
you don't ever have to make a wish
for me to love you.

2131
02:21:43,329 --> 02:21:45,706
I'm here because I love you.

2132
02:21:48,125 --> 02:21:50,127
I just...

2133
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:54,048
I just wish and I pray that, one day,
I'll be able to make you proud enough

2134
02:21:54,215 --> 02:21:56,676
that you'll be able to forgive me.

2135
02:21:58,260 --> 02:22:00,179
And love me.

2136
02:22:00,346 --> 02:22:03,015
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

2137
02:22:03,307 --> 02:22:06,268
I don't need you to make me proud.

2138
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:08,729
I already love you, Daddy.

2139
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,981
You're my dad.

2140
02:22:20,783 --> 02:22:22,201
[Maxwell sobs]

2141
02:22:58,112 --> 02:23:00,030
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

2142
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:03,325
It's okay. [laughs] It's okay.

2143
02:23:03,492 --> 02:23:04,952
[children laughing]

2144
02:23:05,786 --> 02:23:06,996
[man gasping in awe]

2145
02:23:08,414 --> 02:23:10,541
So beautiful.

2146
02:23:15,838 --> 02:23:20,176
[chuckles] Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

2147
02:23:22,553 --> 02:23:24,346
It's all right.

2148
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:25,681
It's just that...

2149
02:23:26,432 --> 02:23:31,187
It's wonderful. It's so many things.

2150
02:23:32,271 --> 02:23:33,689
Yeah.

2151
02:23:34,857 --> 02:23:36,734
I know what you mean.

2152
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:44,116
I like your...

2153
02:23:44,283 --> 02:23:45,367
I like your outfit.

2154
02:23:46,035 --> 02:23:47,578
You like...

2155
02:23:47,745 --> 02:23:48,746
Thanks.

2156
02:23:48,913 --> 02:23:50,873
You know, my friends...

2157
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:54,210
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

2158
02:23:54,376 --> 02:23:55,628
- You look great.
- Thank you.

2159
02:23:56,253 --> 02:23:58,547
You just made my day.

2160
02:24:06,555 --> 02:24:09,266
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

2161
02:24:17,775 --> 02:24:18,859
[sighs]

2162
02:24:19,026 --> 02:24:20,444
[imperceptible]

2163
02:24:49,348 --> 02:24:52,434
So many things.

2164
02:24:54,979 --> 02:24:58,482
So, so many things.

2165
02:25:17,877 --> 02:25:19,712
[siren wailing]

2166
02:26:25,986 --> 02:26:27,821
[indistinct chattering]

2167
02:26:34,703 --> 02:26:36,538
- [man 1 ] Whoa!
- [man 2] Look out!

2168
02:26:36,622 --> 02:26:38,123
[people screaming]

2169
02:26:39,249 --> 02:26:40,668
Oh, my God.

2170
02:26:42,586 --> 02:26:44,296
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

2171
02:26:44,463 --> 02:26:45,464
Um, excuse me.

2172
02:26:45,714 --> 02:26:49,176
Excuse me. Please, you have to let me
thank you, Miss...

2173
02:26:50,594 --> 02:26:51,804
Asteria.

2174
02:26:51,971 --> 02:26:54,556
Asteria. Wow. That's a beautiful name.

2175
02:26:54,723 --> 02:26:56,266
It's from my culture.

2176
02:26:56,433 --> 02:26:58,644
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

2177
02:26:58,727 --> 02:27:00,562
How did you do that?

2178
02:27:00,729 --> 02:27:04,066
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

2179
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:07,903
But I've been doing this a long time.

2180
02:27:12,783 --> 02:27:13,617
[gasps]
