2
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,868
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

3
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,636
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

4
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,467
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

5
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:00,063
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

6
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,627
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

7
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,232
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

8
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,026
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

9
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,682
<i>And mankind?</i>

10
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,771
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

11
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:30,941
<i>What one does when faced with the truth...
is more difficult than you think.</i>

12
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:42,987
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

13
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:46,076
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>And now...</i>

15
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,502
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

16
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,636
Merci.

17
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:50,970
Hello, Diana.

18
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,901
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

19
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:54,797
<i>Diana!</i>

20
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,233
Diana!

21
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,845
Come back!

22
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,238
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

23
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,288
How is she?

24
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,583
She's good.

25
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:44,092
- Keep working.
- I will.

26
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,122
Niobi.

27
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:09,734
Diana!

28
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,842
Diana, I see you.

29
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:21,334
Where are you going?
Slow down!

30
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:33,442
Hello mother.

31
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:35,544
How are you today?

32
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,664
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

33
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:43,251
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

34
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,710
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

35
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,776
Does she?

36
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,979
I could begin showing
her some things.

37
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,945
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

38
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,285
From whom?

39
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,367
In the event of an invasion.

40
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:01,869
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

41
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,372
...leading an entire army,
General?

42
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,537
I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.

43
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:11,812
But you know,
a scorpion must sting...

44
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,496
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

45
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:17,085
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

46
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,131
But, mother...

47
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,529
There will be no training.

48
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,777
What if I promise to be careful?

49
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:31,609
It's time to sleep.

50
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,606
What if I didn't use a sword?

51
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:38,508
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

52
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,433
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

53
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,704
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

54
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,598
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

55
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:53,364
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

56
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:55,198
You've told me this story.

57
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:59,314
Which is why... tonight
I will tell you a new one.

58
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:03,126
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

59
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,186
Yes!

60
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,400
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

61
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,975
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

62
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,605
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

63
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,108
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

64
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:25,942
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

65
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,717
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

66
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:34,765
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

67
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,627
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

68
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,458
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

69
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:47,664
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

70
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,031
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

71
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,506
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

72
00:06:57,713 --> 00:07:01,877
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

73
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:04,171
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

74
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:07,366
<i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

75
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,482
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

76
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:15,131
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

77
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:17,830
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

78
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,955
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

79
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,279
<i>But it did not last.</i>

80
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,773
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

81
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,876
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

82
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:55,174
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

83
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:58,507
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

84
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,863
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

85
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:07,652
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

86
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:13,197
<i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

87
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,594
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

88
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,933
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

89
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:21,869
<i>An endless war...</i>

90
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,458
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

91
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:29,026
<i>...and us with them.</i>

92
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,728
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

93
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,027
<i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i>

94
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:40,247
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i>

95
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:42,421
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

96
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,044
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

97
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,825
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

98
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,683
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

99
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,111
And the God Killer?

100
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:12,914
The God Killer?

101
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,630
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

102
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,954
Can I see it?

103
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,944
The Gods gave us many gifts.

104
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,145
One day, you'll know them all.

105
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:35,660
This great tower
is where we keep them.

106
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:49,322
The God Killer.

107
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,569
It's beautiful.

108
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,527
Who would wield it?

109
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,681
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

110
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,371
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

111
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,783
And that's not you, Diana.

112
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,986
You see?
You are safe...

113
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:15,408
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

114
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,381
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

115
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,810
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

116
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,466
No, I don't.

117
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:43,151
You arestronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.

118
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,461
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

119
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,304
Are you hurt?

120
00:10:58,619 --> 00:10:59,813
No, Mother, I'm fine.

121
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,707
- I was just...
- Training.

122
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,629
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

123
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,149
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

124
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,500
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

125
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:11,762
Take her to the palace.

126
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,050
Off you go.

127
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,415
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

128
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:29,751
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

129
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,088
You speak of a time
that may never come.

130
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:38,194
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

131
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:41,106
Ares is alive.

132
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,811
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

133
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,890
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

134
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:55,692
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

135
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,581
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

136
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:03,127
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

137
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,524
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

138
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,937
Five times harder...

139
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,319
...ten times harder.

140
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,422
Until she's better
than even you.

141
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,825
But she must never
know the truth...

142
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:29,482
about what she is...

143
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,230
...or how she came to be.

144
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,886
Harder.

145
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,044
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

146
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,086
Again.

147
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,915
Never let your guard down.

148
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,752
You expect the battle to be fair.

149
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,514
A battle will never be fair.

150
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,534
Antiope!

151
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,449
Lay still..

152
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,976
You're bleeding.

153
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,478
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

154
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:25,951
What had I done?

155
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,225
I'm sorry.

156
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,496
Where did this fog come from?

157
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,117
There...
Go forward.

158
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:26,950
<i>There he is!</i>

159
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,682
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

160
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,702
Wow.

161
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,010
You are a man.

162
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,227
Yeah. I mean...

163
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:16,917
Do I not look like one?

164
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,653
Where are we?

165
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,645
Themyscira.

166
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:25,777
What?

167
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,352
Who are you?

168
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:38,342
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

169
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:39,548
What?

170
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,695
The Germans.
Come on, we need to get out of here.

171
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,451
- The Germans?
- Diana!

172
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,217
Step away from her. Now!

173
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:50,298
Ready your bows!

174
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,711
They have guns.
Right?

175
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,596
Fire!

176
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:00,936
Come on!

177
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Stay down!

178
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:19,468
Shield!

179
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,700
No!

180
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,900
No!

181
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,110
No.

182
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,119
No. No.
Antiope.

183
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,874
Antiope, hey.

184
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,719
Diana.

185
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:05,405
- The time has come.
- No.

186
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:08,344
You... you must...

187
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,640
What?
What, Antiope?

188
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:16,877
God Killer!

189
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,607
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

190
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:21,595
- Where?
- Go...

191
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,024
No, please no.
No, no!

192
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,410
- No!
- Antiope!

193
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,375
No!

194
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,225
- You.
- No..

195
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,655
No mother no.

196
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,289
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

197
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,635
What man fights against
his own people?

198
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:48,568
These aren't my people.

199
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,888
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

200
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:53,946
I can't tell you that.

201
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,323
You need to tell us now!

202
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,314
What's your name?

203
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,076
I can't tell you that either.

204
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,924
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

205
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,251
If he dies...

206
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,801
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

207
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:17,805
My...

208
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:23,985
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

209
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,373
Serial number 8141921.

210
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,335
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

211
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:39,846
What the hell is this thing?

212
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:42,848
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

213
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:44,745
But it's really hot.

214
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,751
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

215
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,097
What is your mission?

216
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:53,960
Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.

217
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,500
What is your mission?

218
00:23:58,629 --> 00:23:59,630
I am a...

219
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,329
I am a...

220
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,340
I'm a spy.

221
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,784
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

222
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,998
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

223
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,793
<i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i>

224
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,843
<i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

225
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,942
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

226
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,761
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

227
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:36,606
<i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

228
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:41,370
<i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i>

229
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:43,713
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

230
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:45,322
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

231
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:52,065
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i>

232
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:56,402
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

233
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:58,814
<i>And for good reason.</i>

234
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:31,405
<i>From what I could tell if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

235
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:34,826
<i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

236
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:36,988
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

237
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:40,234
<i>...but, I had
to do something.</i>

238
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,900
...penetrate the mask. Which is...
I need more time.

239
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:53,745
Unfortunately Dr.,
we do not have more time.

240
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,235
This work, this...

241
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:03,488
Get that man!

242
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:04,577
Now!

243
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:01,316
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

244
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:05,135
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

245
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,527
It could stop the war.

246
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,823
War? What war?

247
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:13,528
The War.

248
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,901
The war to-to end all wars.

249
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,905
Four years...

250
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,679
27 countries...
25 million dead.

251
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,999
Soldiers and civilians.

252
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,557
Innocent people...

253
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,471
...women and
children slaughtered.

254
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:39,058
Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.

255
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:46,301
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

256
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:50,242
...ever imagine.

257
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:56,716
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

258
00:27:57,747 --> 00:27:59,854
It's like the world's gonna end.

259
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,973
Should we let him go?

260
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:06,077
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

261
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,150
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

262
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,122
Mother, excuse me...

263
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:14,405
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

264
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,728
What are you talking
about, child?

265
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:19,200
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

266
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:21,948
Millions of people already dead.

267
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,589
Like nothing he's ever seen.

268
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:26,528
Only Ares could do such a thing.

269
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:31,822
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

270
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:35,353
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

271
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:36,212
...to go and fight their war.

272
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:38,132
It's not their war.

273
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:41,386
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

274
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:43,802
That was a story, Diana!

275
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,488
This much, you
do not understand?

276
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,490
Men are easily corrupted.

277
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:49,025
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

278
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:52,837
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

279
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:56,609
And stopping the God of war
is our fore-ordinance.

280
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,518
As Amazons this is our duty.

281
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:02,974
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

282
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:04,910
So you will do nothing.

283
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:07,078
As your queen I forbid it.

284
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:21,364
Strange.

285
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:24,885
Is it true you saved his life?

286
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:26,592
Who told you that?

287
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:27,942
He did.

288
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:55,435
Ah... I didn't see you come in.

289
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,296
Would you say you are a...

290
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:07,957
...a typical example
of your sex?

291
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,478
I am...

292
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,743
...above average.

293
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,716
What's that?

294
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,016
It's a...

295
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,124
Oh...

296
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:30,007
It's a watch.

297
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,830
A watch?

298
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,202
Yeah, it's a watch.

299
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,837
Tells time.

300
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:37,375
My father gave it to me.

301
00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:40,577
Went through hell 'n back with him.

302
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,933
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

303
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:47,055
What for?

304
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:50,597
Because it tells time.

305
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:54,477
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

306
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,977
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

307
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:00,743
Yeah...

308
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,649
Can I ask you some questions?

309
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:11,892
- Where are we?
- Themyscira.

310
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:15,673
No, I got that before, but I mean...
where are we?

311
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,569
What is this place?
Who are you people?

312
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,877
Why does the water do that?

313
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,529
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

314
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:25,312
We speak hundreds of languages.

315
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:29,577
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

316
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,031
Right.

317
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:39,212
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this...

318
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:44,874
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

319
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:47,684
Thank you...

320
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,613
...for what you
did on the beach.

321
00:31:58,589 --> 00:31:59,589
So...

322
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,411
...you are here to let me go?

323
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:07,275
I tried, but it's not up to me.

324
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,665
I even asked them to
send me with you..

325
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,656
Or anyone.

326
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,015
An Amazon.

327
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:17,070
The Amazons.

328
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:18,280
The Amazons?

329
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:21,181
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

330
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,063
And I wish to go..

331
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,892
But my mother will not allow it.

332
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,366
Well...

333
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,254
I can't say I blame her.

334
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:37,456
The way this war's going...

335
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,957
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

336
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:42,418
Then why do you want to go back?

337
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,065
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

338
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,420
I guess I gotta try.

339
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,943
My father told me
once he said...

340
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,030
"If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

341
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,690
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

342
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,393
And I already tried nothing.

343
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:42,553
Nice outfit.

344
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:44,426
Oh, thank you.

345
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,275
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

346
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,605
...and you'll take me to Ares.

347
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:52,706
Deal.

348
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:02,889
I am leaving on that?

349
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,396
We are..

350
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,767
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

351
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,369
Do you not know how to sail?

352
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,846
Of course I know how to sail.

353
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,818
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

354
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,288
It's been a while.

355
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,885
I am going, mother.

356
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:49,882
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

357
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,271
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

358
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:58,302
I have to go.

359
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,801
I know.

360
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,578
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

361
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:10,903
There is so much...

362
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:12,980
So much you do not understand.

363
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,202
I understand enough.

364
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,549
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

365
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:22,830
Like you once did.

366
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,438
You know that if you
choose to leave...

367
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:28,656
...you may never return.

368
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,428
Who will I be if I stay?

369
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:44,357
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

370
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,857
...our beloved Antiope.

371
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,391
Make sure you're worthy of it.

372
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,551
I will.

373
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,022
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

374
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:02,132
They do not deserve you.

375
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,519
You have been my greatest love.

376
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:14,964
Today...

377
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:19,645
...you are my greatest sorrow.

378
00:38:57,763 --> 00:38:59,416
Should you have told her?

379
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:04,632
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

380
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:17,990
How long until we reach the war?

381
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,325
The war, which part?

382
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,161
The Western Front in France is...

383
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,564
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

384
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,105
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

385
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:32,159
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

386
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:38,115
Ares as in...
the God of War?

387
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,216
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

388
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,128
With this.

389
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,883
And once I do...

390
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,044
...the war will end.

391
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,332
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

392
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:01,271
...but this war is...

393
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,283
It's a great big mess.

394
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,682
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

395
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:10,550
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

396
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:12,629
I'm the man who can!

397
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:14,849
Once I find and destroy Ares...

398
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:17,726
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

399
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:20,312
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

400
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:25,943
Great.

401
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:27,680
You will see.

402
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,067
What are you doing?

403
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,211
I thought maybe you wanna...

404
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:37,415
...get some sleep.

405
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:43,286
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

406
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,379
Does the average man not sleep?

407
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:52,426
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

408
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:53,843
You don't sleep with women?

409
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,776
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

410
00:40:58,213 --> 00:40:59,569
Yes, I do.

411
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:01,206
But out of the...

412
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:05,320
...confines of marriage.

413
00:41:08,904 --> 00:41:10,879
Not polite to assume, you know?

414
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,227
"Marriage"?

415
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,112
Weird! You don't have that...

416
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:20,761
You go before a judge...

417
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:25,568
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

418
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:26,770
...until death do you apart.

419
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:29,592
And do they... love
each other till death?

420
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,709
Not very often, no.

421
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,161
Then why do they do it?

422
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:35,767
I have no idea.

423
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:39,594
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you...

424
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:41,436
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

425
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:42,521
There is plenty of room.

426
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:45,113
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

427
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,948
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

428
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:49,158
Okay.

429
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:15,363
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

430
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:18,719
You know, um...
being a spy...

431
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:22,092
You have to show a
certain amount of...

432
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:24,941
...vigor.

433
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,608
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

434
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,457
I have no father.

435
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,752
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

436
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:38,168
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

437
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:42,592
Well that's neat.

438
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,305
Sorry.

439
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:51,797
Where I come from...

440
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,411
...babies are made differently.

441
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:58,308
You refer to
reproductive biology.

442
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,026
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

443
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:02,339
I know all about that.

444
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:05,426
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

445
00:43:06,357 --> 00:43:07,655
The pleasures of the flesh.

446
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,108
Do you know about that?

447
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:17,318
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures.

448
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,500
All 12, huh?

449
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,098
Did you bring any
of those with you?

450
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:28,868
You would not enjoy them.

451
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,303
I don't know.
May be.

452
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,524
No you wouldn't.

453
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:32,790
Why not?

454
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:36,430
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation...

455
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,455
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

456
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:40,653
...unnecessary.

457
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:41,824
No.

458
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:48,135
Goodnight.

459
00:44:02,254 --> 00:44:03,654
How long until we're operational?

460
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:05,276
Two days, sir.

461
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:07,159
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

462
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,504
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

463
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:13,666
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

464
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:16,145
Do you hear me making excuses?

465
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:16,945
No.

466
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:18,844
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

467
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,489
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

468
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,019
...from any cover!

469
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,700
So let's you and I remind them...

470
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:25,861
Shall we?

471
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,216
- Doctor.
- General.

472
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,447
Progress?

473
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:44,876
Not enough.

474
00:44:45,688 --> 00:44:47,519
It is over, General.

475
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,604
Germany is giving up.

476
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:53,698
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

477
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:55,988
We have run out of time.

478
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,343
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

479
00:45:00,592 --> 00:45:02,315
...he will not
sign the armistice.

480
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:03,503
But without my notebook...

481
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,088
We will get your book!

482
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:07,600
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

483
00:45:09,024 --> 00:45:12,080
I know that you can
and will succeed...

484
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:17,157
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

485
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:24,138
Something, did come
to me last night.

486
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,363
A different type of gas.

487
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:28,498
For you.

488
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:30,949
To restore your strength.

489
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,725
I have got it!
I have got it!

490
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:06,978
And if it's what I think...

491
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,145
It's going to be...

492
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:13,162
...terrible.

493
00:46:34,655 --> 00:46:35,729
Morning!

494
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:38,819
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

495
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,505
Welcome to jolly old London!

496
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,433
It's hideous.

497
00:46:43,642 --> 00:46:45,446
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

498
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:09,070
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

499
00:47:09,323 --> 00:47:10,324
Oh no!

500
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:12,814
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

501
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,639
Come on!

502
00:47:18,223 --> 00:47:19,756
Why are they holding hands?

503
00:47:20,696 --> 00:47:22,879
Probably because
they're together.

504
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,265
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

505
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,551
This way.

506
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,652
To the war!

507
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:33,640
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

508
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,996
And where are we going?

509
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:36,988
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

510
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,309
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

511
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,481
No, no, no, no. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

512
00:47:41,747 --> 00:47:43,479
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

513
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,942
And a deal is a promise.

514
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:47,084
And a promise is unbreakable.

515
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:50,039
Oi, damn it, alright.

516
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:52,822
Come with me first
to deliver this...

517
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:54,679
...and then we'll
get you a ticket...

518
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:56,697
...to the war.

519
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,981
Deal?

520
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:00,615
- Let's go.
- Diana...

521
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:01,640
What are you doing?

522
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:04,081
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

523
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:07,317
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

524
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:09,522
What do these women
wear into battle?

525
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:10,899
They don't...

526
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:12,762
A baby!

527
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,258
No, no.
No babies.

528
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,140
This one's not made out of clay.

529
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,505
Come on.

530
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,734
Diana! Please.

531
00:48:38,156 --> 00:48:39,389
Thank God! You're not dead!

532
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,693
Hurray!

533
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:46,027
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

534
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,969
He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.

535
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:50,293
Very unlike him.

536
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:52,749
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

537
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,767
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

538
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:56,252
What is a secretary?

539
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:57,907
Well, I do everything.

540
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,561
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

541
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,061
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

542
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:04,334
I really like her.

543
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,921
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

544
00:49:05,922 --> 00:49:07,091
Oh, I do, I like her.

545
00:49:15,754 --> 00:49:19,775
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

546
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:22,407
Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.

547
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:24,040
Keeps our tummies in.

548
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:25,743
Why must you keep them in?

549
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:28,201
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

550
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:33,415
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

551
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,964
Try it on at least.

552
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:37,342
Very well.

553
00:49:38,731 --> 00:49:39,732
No!

554
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:48,109
Come on!

555
00:49:57,382 --> 00:50:00,044
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

556
00:50:00,423 --> 00:50:01,433
Fight?

557
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,042
We use our principles.

558
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:04,999
I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.

559
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:08,827
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups...

560
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:10,752
...should the occasion arise.

561
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,412
Lovely.

562
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:17,376
It's itching.
It's choking me.

563
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,728
Can they blame it?

564
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,263
Etta.

565
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:23,541
Where is she?

566
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,025
She's trying on up to number 226.

567
00:50:35,711 --> 00:50:38,938
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

568
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,178
...distracting.

569
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:43,707
May I?

570
00:50:48,232 --> 00:50:49,546
Yeah, really? Specs?

571
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,200
Certainly she's not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

572
00:50:58,667 --> 00:50:59,861
Better.

573
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,282
Yep, that's not gonna work.

574
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:14,209
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

575
00:51:14,461 --> 00:51:15,462
Diana!

576
00:51:16,683 --> 00:51:17,684
Let me try it by myself.

577
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,990
After you, sir.

578
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:29,566
Etta...

579
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:32,258
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

580
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:34,329
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

581
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:35,609
Oh no, I don't think so.

582
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:37,439
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

583
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:39,447
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

584
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,734
Put the sword down,
first of all.

585
00:51:44,324 --> 00:51:47,730
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

586
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:50,136
Yes... no.

587
00:51:50,406 --> 00:51:52,329
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

588
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:54,506
- Shield.
- And the shield to her...

589
00:51:55,938 --> 00:51:56,970
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

590
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,212
This is easy.

591
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:01,544
There we go.

592
00:52:29,515 --> 00:52:30,557
What is it?

593
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,632
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

594
00:52:44,357 --> 00:52:46,399
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

595
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:57,632
Captain Trevor.

596
00:52:58,557 --> 00:53:01,545
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

597
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:05,779
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

598
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,136
Give us Dr. Maru's note book.

599
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:10,366
Where I put that thing?

600
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:13,343
Stand back!

601
00:53:24,528 --> 00:53:25,529
Or maybe not.

602
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:42,616
Oh, tough luck.

603
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:51,444
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

604
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:54,135
Where do you think you're going?

605
00:54:00,877 --> 00:54:03,368
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

606
00:54:03,963 --> 00:54:06,276
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

607
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:07,976
Where will I find Ares?

608
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,189
He's... He's dead.

609
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:19,643
Cyanide.

610
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,246
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

611
00:54:30,488 --> 00:54:33,121
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

612
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:39,949
<i>Let him speak!</i>

613
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:41,307
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

614
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:45,956
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

615
00:54:47,213 --> 00:54:49,114
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

616
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:52,141
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

617
00:54:52,142 --> 00:54:54,777
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

618
00:54:54,877 --> 00:54:57,463
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

619
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,737
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

620
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:03,127
...an armistice.

621
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,333
<i>There's a woman.</i>

622
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:07,787
What is she doing here?
Get her out.

623
00:55:09,752 --> 00:55:10,993
Ger her out.

624
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:12,637
Sorry.

625
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,140
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom.

626
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:17,319
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

627
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:20,001
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

628
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,846
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

629
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:24,850
<i>...at any cost!</i>

630
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,756
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

631
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:32,368
Not right now!

632
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:39,953
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

633
00:55:39,954 --> 00:55:41,966
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

634
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,184
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

635
00:55:44,284 --> 00:55:44,920
Notebook or notes...

636
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:45,848
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

637
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,627
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

638
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:49,710
You do not just barge in here.

639
00:55:49,744 --> 00:55:51,478
Sir with all due respect.
What I saw in my last trip...

640
00:55:51,479 --> 00:55:52,615
...will change the
course of war.

641
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,206
Captain Trevor!

642
00:55:56,328 --> 00:55:58,054
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

643
00:55:58,055 --> 00:55:59,486
...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

644
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,437
...and I see you
brought a friend with you.

645
00:56:01,466 --> 00:56:03,228
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

646
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:04,896
No, no no... nonsense.

647
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,865
Thanks to this young woman...

648
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,516
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get at least a few words in.

649
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,818
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

650
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,792
Diana, princess of the...

651
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:16,774
"Prince". Diana Prince.

652
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:18,690
She is...

653
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,941
and I...

654
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,108
...are...

655
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,271
...working together.

656
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,883
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

657
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:26,688
That's from Dr. Maru's lab.

658
00:56:26,713 --> 00:56:29,980
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

659
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:32,005
My... God.

660
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:34,952
- Dr. Poison herself.
- Yes.

661
00:57:05,347 --> 00:57:06,348
Yes.

662
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:08,156
Intriguing.

663
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:09,778
Any further intelligence?

664
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:12,787
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

665
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:14,946
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

666
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:18,740
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

667
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:20,614
Ottoman and Sumerian.

668
00:57:22,948 --> 00:57:25,294
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

669
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:26,605
Who is this woman?

670
00:57:26,874 --> 00:57:28,556
She is my...

671
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,391
...secretary, sir.

672
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:33,124
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

673
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:34,999
She's a very good secretary.

674
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,978
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

675
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:42,035
...we should hear
what she has to say.

676
00:57:42,036 --> 00:57:43,932
Yes, very well.

677
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,761
It's a formula...

678
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:54,741
...for a new kind of gas.

679
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,499
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

680
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,909
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

681
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,721
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

682
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,732
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

683
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,409
At the front?

684
00:58:06,622 --> 00:58:07,421
When?

685
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:08,789
It doesn't say.

686
00:58:09,243 --> 00:58:10,747
Wait. In "front" of what?

687
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:11,865
Sir...

688
00:58:12,066 --> 00:58:13,521
...that is the
evidence we need.

689
00:58:13,522 --> 00:58:15,348
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

690
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:16,725
You have to burn
it to the ground.

691
00:58:16,945 --> 00:58:17,946
Destroy it.

692
00:58:18,022 --> 00:58:20,429
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

693
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:24,812
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

694
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:28,270
...as we are negotiating
their surrender.

695
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:30,174
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

696
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,067
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

697
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:33,938
They will all die.

698
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:37,128
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

699
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:39,897
Send me in... with some
logistical support.

700
00:58:39,947 --> 00:58:42,911
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

701
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:44,037
Are you insane?

702
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:46,698
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

703
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:47,434
Sir, I can take...

704
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:48,918
Now more than ever...

705
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:52,862
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

706
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,563
It must be negotiated,
it must be signed...

707
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,380
and this is...

708
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:00,195
It's the best way
of stopping the war.

709
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,310
Captain, you will do nothing.

710
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,628
And that is an order.

711
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:06,518
Yes sir.

712
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:08,872
I understand, sir.

713
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:10,702
I don't!

714
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,471
Diana, I know this confusing...

715
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:14,885
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

716
00:59:14,886 --> 00:59:16,002
She is with me, she is with us.

717
00:59:16,003 --> 00:59:17,163
I'm not... I am not with you!

718
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:20,246
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

719
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:21,710
...as if they mean
less than yours.

720
00:59:21,735 --> 00:59:23,822
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

721
00:59:23,823 --> 00:59:26,857
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

722
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:29,104
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

723
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:30,933
They die with them
on the battlefield!

724
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,658
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

725
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:34,022
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

726
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,952
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

727
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:38,928
Please slow down!

728
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:40,346
That's your leader?

729
00:59:40,674 --> 00:59:42,720
How could he say that?
Believe that?

730
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,376
And... and you!

731
00:59:44,606 --> 00:59:46,866
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

732
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,411
No!

733
00:59:47,419 --> 00:59:49,048
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

734
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:50,721
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

735
00:59:50,722 --> 00:59:54,022
This is Ares and he's not
going to allow a negotiation

736
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,459
or a surrender!

737
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:58,186
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

738
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,571
We are going anyway!

739
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:03,776
You mean you were lying?

740
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:05,876
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

741
01:00:05,976 --> 01:00:08,094
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

742
01:00:13,097 --> 01:00:14,653
I'm taking you to the front.

743
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:17,048
We are probably gonna die.

744
01:00:18,127 --> 01:00:20,075
This is a terrible idea.

745
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:26,513
We're gonna need reinforcements.

746
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:39,287
These are the reinforcements?

747
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:40,313
Yep.

748
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:42,403
Are these even good men?

749
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:44,614
Well, relatively.

750
01:00:45,762 --> 01:00:49,804
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

751
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:54,110
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

752
01:00:54,135 --> 01:00:56,498
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

753
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,490
Which prince is that?

754
01:00:59,116 --> 01:01:01,258
I decided to extend
your profanity...

755
01:01:01,259 --> 01:01:02,881
But seriously, which prince?

756
01:01:03,736 --> 01:01:06,350
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

757
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:08,300
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

758
01:01:08,872 --> 01:01:11,004
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

759
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,673
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

760
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:17,012
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

761
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:19,125
Oh my goodness, gracious.

762
01:01:20,115 --> 01:01:20,948
That's a work of art.

763
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:23,227
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

764
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:25,505
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

765
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,339
"Sammy".

766
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,880
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

767
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:30,229
Sameer is a top undercover man.

768
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:32,899
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

769
01:01:33,214 --> 01:01:35,908
<i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i>

770
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,561
<i>You do for me.</i>

771
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:40,846
<i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i>

772
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,023
<i>And your eyes...</i>

773
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:44,926
<i>...looks like they want something.</i>

774
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,284
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

775
01:01:47,326 --> 01:01:49,568
<i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

776
01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:52,932
Oh, you're done.

777
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:53,958
Where is Charlie?

778
01:01:58,086 --> 01:01:59,087
Voila!

779
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:04,225
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

780
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:06,626
That's not Charlie.

781
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:15,710
That's Charlie.

782
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:21,149
Steven!

783
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:24,139
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

784
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,283
Good to see you.

785
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,752
So what were you fighting about?

786
01:02:29,995 --> 01:02:32,486
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

787
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,221
This man is no fighter.

788
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:36,443
Charlie is an expert marksman.

789
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:38,325
Means he shoots people.

790
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,915
From very far away.

791
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,510
They never know what hit 'em.

792
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,740
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

793
01:02:45,941 --> 01:02:48,103
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

794
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,701
You fight without honor.

795
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:51,858
Who gets paid for honor?

796
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:54,625
So, what's the job, boss?

797
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:57,139
Two days tops.

798
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,762
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

799
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:01,094
What's the going rate?

800
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:01,907
Better be a good pay.

801
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,119
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

802
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:07,984
Ehm... I told you it was going to be quick.

803
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,929
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

804
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,128
It's for a great cause...

805
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:15,428
...Freedom.

806
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:17,370
Friendship...

807
01:03:19,939 --> 01:03:21,136
...ending the war, friendship...

808
01:03:21,137 --> 01:03:22,493
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

809
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:25,771
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

810
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,751
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

811
01:03:29,136 --> 01:03:30,256
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

812
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:32,158
What?

813
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:33,283
What is this?

814
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:34,644
We're gonna drop her up at front!

815
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:36,537
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

816
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:39,385
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

817
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,715
...with helping every last human.

818
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,341
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

819
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,239
I am both frightened and aroused.

820
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,412
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

821
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,056
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

822
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:13,092
- Sir Patrick.
- No, no, no, no...

823
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:15,571
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit.

824
01:04:20,408 --> 01:04:22,321
I assume you are here
planning something...

825
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:25,368
...that's going to get you
either court martialed or killed.

826
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,609
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

827
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,160
No.

828
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:31,451
Not at all in fact...

829
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:33,217
Well, look.

830
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:34,409
I was an younger man once.

831
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:38,320
And had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.

832
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,854
It's a very very honorable
thing you're doing.

833
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:42,654
Therefore...

834
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:44,933
...I am here to help.

835
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:46,907
Unofficially, of course.

836
01:04:48,048 --> 01:04:49,276
What's your plan?

837
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:53,912
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

838
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:56,189
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

839
01:04:57,278 --> 01:04:59,862
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

840
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,209
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

841
01:05:05,563 --> 01:05:06,564
"Run"...

842
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:09,709
Also.

843
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:13,202
...There is enough
here for a few days.

844
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:19,847
Thank you sir.

845
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,323
You're very welcome.

846
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:23,949
Take great care all of you...

847
01:05:23,974 --> 01:05:24,975
...and good luck.

848
01:05:46,283 --> 01:05:48,185
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

849
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:50,190
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

850
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:51,730
- Me?
- You hungry?

851
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:52,983
Yes.

852
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:54,162
Thank you.

853
01:05:54,187 --> 01:05:55,628
Eight pence please, sir.

854
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,092
There you go, and keep the change.

855
01:05:57,093 --> 01:05:58,635
Thank you very much sir.

856
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:01,288
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

857
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:02,465
Yeah.

858
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,092
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

859
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:07,494
You should be very proud.

860
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,775
I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.

861
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:23,028
Chief?

862
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:25,634
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

863
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:27,828
Very reputable.

864
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:31,234
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

865
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:32,839
Lovely.

866
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:34,510
Careful, I might get offended.

867
01:06:34,534 --> 01:06:36,036
I wasn't referring to you.

868
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:37,888
Really?

869
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:40,150
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

870
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:42,224
...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

871
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:44,830
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

872
01:07:04,383 --> 01:07:05,384
It's awful.

873
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:08,167
That's why we're here.

874
01:07:26,306 --> 01:07:28,042
The gas will kill everything.

875
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,491
What kind of weapon
kills innocents?

876
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:32,912
In this war...

877
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,181
...every kind.

878
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:42,544
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

879
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:45,426
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

880
01:07:45,451 --> 01:07:47,955
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

881
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:51,838
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

882
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,094
We don't.

883
01:07:53,419 --> 01:07:55,449
There are shortages of food...

884
01:07:55,474 --> 01:07:57,319
...meds and ammunition.

885
01:07:58,326 --> 01:08:02,210
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

886
01:08:02,335 --> 01:08:05,067
One attack and the
world could be ours.

887
01:08:07,428 --> 01:08:09,459
As we speak, my chemistry...

888
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:11,631
We stand against you and your...

889
01:08:11,656 --> 01:08:12,895
...witch.

890
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:18,810
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

891
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:20,807
...this war will end.

892
01:08:21,355 --> 01:08:22,991
It is over.

893
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,608
It's over for you.

894
01:08:29,512 --> 01:08:30,821
It is over for all of you.

895
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,448
But the mask won't help.

896
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:50,716
They don't know that.

897
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:06,928
Let's go.

898
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:09,605
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

899
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:12,979
You're late.

900
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:14,238
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

901
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:16,582
How are you?

902
01:09:17,497 --> 01:09:19,493
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

903
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:23,734
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

904
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,128
Good to see you my friend.

905
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:28,115
Yaa beauty!

906
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,910
Who is this?

907
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,466
And I am Diana.

908
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:40,907
Where did you find her?

909
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:42,335
She found me.

910
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,940
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

911
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:46,541
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

912
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:47,943
What's there?

913
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,234
British tea from the Germans...

914
01:09:51,489 --> 01:09:53,450
...German beer for the British.

915
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:57,540
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

916
01:09:57,751 --> 01:09:59,052
And guns!

917
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:03,821
Well...
May we get what we want?

918
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,054
May we get what we need.

919
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:07,449
But may we never get
what we deserve.

920
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:08,475
Bang!

921
01:10:16,099 --> 01:10:17,323
Strange thunder.

922
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:20,345
German 77's.

923
01:10:20,694 --> 01:10:22,116
Guns, big ones.

924
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,677
It's the front out there.

925
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:29,905
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

926
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,199
I don't fight.

927
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:33,089
You're here for profits then?

928
01:10:33,574 --> 01:10:35,535
No better place to be.

929
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:39,007
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

930
01:10:39,426 --> 01:10:41,583
I have no where else.
The last war took

931
01:10:41,608 --> 01:10:44,248
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

932
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,313
At least here...

933
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,099
...I'm free.

934
01:10:48,918 --> 01:10:50,683
Who took that from your people?

935
01:10:51,445 --> 01:10:52,626
His people.

936
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,631
<i>Don't go...</i>

937
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:02,281
<i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i>

938
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,639
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

939
01:11:05,664 --> 01:11:06,762
You are safe.

940
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:09,593
You are safe.
Are you okay?

941
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:11,162
Shut up, you woman!

942
01:11:11,187 --> 01:11:12,940
Stop making a fuss!

943
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:14,422
God!

944
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,882
He sees ghosts.

945
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,908
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

946
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:28,155
Oh I do...

947
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:31,084
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

948
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:53,264
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

949
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,407
Because they need to move quick!

950
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:57,852
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

951
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,487
I could help them.

952
01:11:59,488 --> 01:12:00,791
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

953
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,221
Mama!

954
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,104
That man... he's wounded.

955
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:14,562
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

956
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:16,144
We must keep moving.

957
01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:38,272
What is this?

958
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:40,379
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

959
01:12:40,446 --> 01:12:41,876
Then where are the Germans?

960
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,384
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

961
01:12:44,648 --> 01:12:46,071
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

962
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,758
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

963
01:12:51,058 --> 01:12:53,223
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

964
01:12:54,408 --> 01:12:55,691
Alright, let's move.

965
01:12:56,924 --> 01:12:58,665
<i>Help me please.</i>

966
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,830
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

967
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:02,837
<i>...houses, food...</i>

968
01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:04,917
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

969
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:07,033
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

970
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,276
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

971
01:13:08,277 --> 01:13:11,557
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

972
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:12,655
Diana, we have to go.

973
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:14,093
We need to help these people.

974
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:15,265
We have to stay on mission!

975
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,947
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

976
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:19,729
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

977
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,264
These people are dying.

978
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:23,140
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

979
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,790
- <i>enslaved</i>, she said!
- I understand that.

980
01:13:24,796 --> 01:13:25,796
Women! Children!

981
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,090
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

982
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:29,138
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

983
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:31,761
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

984
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,285
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

985
01:13:34,586 --> 01:13:36,709
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

986
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:39,292
...and they barely
gained an inch.

987
01:13:39,506 --> 01:13:42,205
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

988
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:45,032
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

989
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:47,531
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

990
01:13:47,532 --> 01:13:48,924
So what? So we do nothing?

991
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:51,015
No, we are doing something.

992
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:52,395
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

993
01:13:52,642 --> 01:13:54,031
We can't save
everyone in this war.

994
01:13:54,258 --> 01:13:55,490
Steve...

995
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,380
This is not what we
came here to do.

996
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:14,830
No...

997
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:16,782
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

998
01:14:32,056 --> 01:14:33,315
Diana!

999
01:14:55,502 --> 01:14:57,793
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

1000
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:05,458
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1001
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,486
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1002
01:15:20,173 --> 01:15:22,062
Sniper! stay down!

1003
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:23,610
Stay down! That's an order!

1004
01:16:16,797 --> 01:16:17,798
Come on!

1005
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:19,702
She's done it!
Let's go!

1006
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:40,726
Steve!

1007
01:16:41,157 --> 01:16:42,304
Let's go!

1008
01:16:45,051 --> 01:16:46,808
Come on, go!

1009
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,817
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1010
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:45,633
- What the...
- Let's move.

1011
01:18:24,018 --> 01:18:25,445
We need more firepower.

1012
01:19:41,941 --> 01:19:42,942
Sniper!

1013
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:44,219
Move!

1014
01:19:46,555 --> 01:19:47,320
Get in!

1015
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:49,028
Charlie, bell tower.

1016
01:19:57,284 --> 01:19:58,554
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1017
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,667
It's okay.

1018
01:20:06,645 --> 01:20:08,647
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1019
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:16,409
Good!

1020
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,489
We're gonna put this on our
backs and when I say go...

1021
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:20,675
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1022
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:23,859
Diana! Shield!

1023
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:28,557
Go!

1024
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:33,134
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1025
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:34,797
Please. It's so important.

1026
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:39,937
Thank you very much.

1027
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:42,831
This has been such an honor
for me taking your photograph.

1028
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:43,922
Thank you so much.

1029
01:21:50,358 --> 01:21:52,577
For obvious talk of shooting...

1030
01:21:52,898 --> 01:21:54,669
...you cannot shoot.

1031
01:21:57,316 --> 01:21:59,734
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1032
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:02,781
Me, I'm an actor.

1033
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,243
I love acting.

1034
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:06,126
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1035
01:22:07,435 --> 01:22:08,776
But I'm the wrong color.

1036
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:12,078
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1037
01:22:13,734 --> 01:22:15,039
Just as you're fighting yours.

1038
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,695
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1039
01:22:22,696 --> 01:22:23,697
<i>Thank you.</i>

1040
01:22:27,812 --> 01:22:29,389
Hi. I'm on the phone...

1041
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:32,879
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1042
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:34,611
It's a tiny village.

1043
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:36,492
It may not even be on the map.

1044
01:22:36,517 --> 01:22:37,808
Ooh! I found it!

1045
01:22:38,062 --> 01:22:39,922
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1046
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:41,661
No. No, but I located him.

1047
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:44,698
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1048
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:46,439
...at German High Command.

1049
01:22:46,896 --> 01:22:48,439
<i>The German High Command?</i>

1050
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:49,916
And to Intel report...

1051
01:22:50,187 --> 01:22:52,408
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala.

1052
01:22:52,624 --> 01:22:53,942
Sort of the last hurrah...

1053
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:56,769
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1054
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:59,649
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1055
01:22:59,876 --> 01:23:02,302
As well as Dr. Maru.

1056
01:23:03,053 --> 01:23:04,700
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1057
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:06,687
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1058
01:23:06,712 --> 01:23:09,916
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1059
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,478
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1060
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,045
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1061
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,888
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1062
01:23:16,353 --> 01:23:17,824
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1063
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:19,818
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1064
01:23:20,072 --> 01:23:21,126
Hold on one second, sir.

1065
01:23:21,151 --> 01:23:23,436
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1066
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:25,113
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1067
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:26,715
What?

1068
01:23:27,241 --> 01:23:28,242
What is that?

1069
01:23:28,501 --> 01:23:30,614
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1070
01:23:32,204 --> 01:23:35,290
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1071
01:23:35,315 --> 01:23:36,992
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1072
01:23:37,557 --> 01:23:38,951
I mean Ares.

1073
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,755
Ludendorff is Ares!

1074
01:23:42,645 --> 01:23:44,687
Sir, this is our last chance...

1075
01:23:44,712 --> 01:23:46,462
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1076
01:23:46,463 --> 01:23:48,788
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1077
01:23:48,813 --> 01:23:50,690
No, no, no, no. I forbid it.

1078
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:51,865
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1079
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:53,616
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1080
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:55,071
- Hello?
- Sir...

1081
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:00,054
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1082
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,360
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1083
01:24:07,988 --> 01:24:09,790
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1084
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:11,382
Sammy, I have to work.

1085
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:15,192
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1086
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:16,490
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1087
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:18,281
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1088
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:19,323
You said yourself, Steve.

1089
01:24:25,242 --> 01:24:26,606
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1090
01:24:44,848 --> 01:24:46,039
You did this.

1091
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,354
We did.

1092
01:24:54,108 --> 01:24:55,700
Do you have dancing on...

1093
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:57,964
...Paradise Island?

1094
01:24:57,989 --> 01:24:59,710
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1095
01:25:00,691 --> 01:25:03,850
These people are just...
swaying.

1096
01:25:04,847 --> 01:25:08,201
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1097
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:11,622
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1098
01:25:11,677 --> 01:25:14,240
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1099
01:25:18,367 --> 01:25:19,818
If you would...

1100
01:25:20,668 --> 01:25:21,669
Well...

1101
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:26,202
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1102
01:25:26,227 --> 01:25:27,362
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1103
01:25:27,363 --> 01:25:29,414
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1104
01:25:29,621 --> 01:25:31,524
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1105
01:25:32,154 --> 01:25:34,505
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1106
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:35,933
Be polite. Be polite.

1107
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,119
All right.
Give me your hand.

1108
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,393
Like so.

1109
01:25:43,064 --> 01:25:46,285
And I'll put my arm...

1110
01:25:46,286 --> 01:25:48,150
...around you like so.

1111
01:25:49,078 --> 01:25:50,962
And we just...

1112
01:25:51,301 --> 01:25:52,704
What do you call it? Sway?

1113
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:53,730
We'll just sway.

1114
01:25:54,419 --> 01:25:55,988
You're awfully close.

1115
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:00,275
Nice ritz.

1116
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,483
I see.

1117
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,430
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1118
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,721
It's started to snowfall.

1119
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:40,143
Touch it.

1120
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:45,120
It's magical!

1121
01:26:45,685 --> 01:26:47,317
It is, isn't it?

1122
01:26:49,506 --> 01:26:50,821
Yes, yeah.

1123
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,886
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1124
01:27:01,857 --> 01:27:02,858
Yeah.

1125
01:27:03,896 --> 01:27:06,899
Yeah, this... and other things.

1126
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:08,572
What things?

1127
01:27:16,082 --> 01:27:17,625
They have breakfast.

1128
01:27:18,246 --> 01:27:19,835
They really love a breakfast.

1129
01:27:19,863 --> 01:27:22,698
And they love to wake up...

1130
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:25,842
...read the paper
and go to work.

1131
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:28,539
They get married.

1132
01:27:29,335 --> 01:27:31,028
Make some babies and
grow old together.

1133
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:32,572
I guess.

1134
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:38,115
What is that like?

1135
01:27:42,245 --> 01:27:43,679
I have no idea.

1136
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:20,118
The villagers gave them to us.

1137
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:23,506
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1138
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,084
You are.

1139
01:29:25,749 --> 01:29:27,446
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1140
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:30,635
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1141
01:29:32,677 --> 01:29:33,878
...and a deal is a deal.

1142
01:29:36,025 --> 01:29:37,483
You can't last without us.

1143
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:39,372
Yeah.

1144
01:29:39,586 --> 01:29:41,748
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1145
01:29:42,309 --> 01:29:44,082
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1146
01:29:44,787 --> 01:29:45,612
No more money.

1147
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:47,029
We have been paid enough.

1148
01:29:50,903 --> 01:29:52,407
No, Charlie.

1149
01:29:53,785 --> 01:29:55,742
Who will sing for us?

1150
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,749
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1151
01:29:59,789 --> 01:30:00,855
Sing?

1152
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:03,245
You asked for it.

1153
01:30:03,426 --> 01:30:05,770
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1154
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:09,871
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1155
01:30:10,134 --> 01:30:13,661
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1156
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:16,897
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1157
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:18,821
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1158
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,177
Every word.

1159
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,931
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1160
01:30:21,932 --> 01:30:24,070
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1161
01:30:24,272 --> 01:30:25,876
And not a single man among them?

1162
01:30:27,347 --> 01:30:28,217
How do we get there?

1163
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:30,418
And she thinks...

1164
01:30:30,419 --> 01:30:32,571
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1165
01:30:32,602 --> 01:30:34,389
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1166
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,742
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1167
01:30:37,936 --> 01:30:39,839
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1168
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,935
The way she took out the tower?

1169
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:45,093
May be it's true.

1170
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:47,483
I think it's true.

1171
01:30:48,105 --> 01:30:49,119
I believe it's true.

1172
01:30:50,204 --> 01:30:53,808
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1173
01:31:17,135 --> 01:31:19,259
Diana, Diana,
hide in, hide in.

1174
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,450
How the hell do
we get into that?

1175
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:26,667
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1176
01:31:26,922 --> 01:31:28,248
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1177
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,014
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1178
01:31:30,015 --> 01:31:30,806
I could get in.

1179
01:31:30,982 --> 01:31:32,992
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1180
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:34,499
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1181
01:31:34,513 --> 01:31:35,783
And you are too distracting.

1182
01:31:36,008 --> 01:31:38,060
Look, I will go in there, follow them to...

1183
01:31:38,061 --> 01:31:40,789
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1184
01:31:41,004 --> 01:31:43,206
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1185
01:31:43,263 --> 01:31:45,195
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1186
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:46,311
I don't know.

1187
01:31:46,312 --> 01:31:49,111
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1188
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:52,644
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1189
01:31:52,669 --> 01:31:54,471
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1190
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,867
You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.

1191
01:31:57,412 --> 01:31:59,221
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1192
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:02,145
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1193
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:04,495
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1194
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:05,691
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1195
01:32:05,793 --> 01:32:07,037
Come on... come on.

1196
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:08,516
Stay put!

1197
01:32:10,462 --> 01:32:11,337
Where this come from?

1198
01:32:11,537 --> 01:32:13,057
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1199
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:18,953
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1200
01:32:18,954 --> 01:32:20,823
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1201
01:32:20,824 --> 01:32:22,400
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1202
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:28,726
Colonel.

1203
01:32:32,913 --> 01:32:35,428
Steve, they have invitations.

1204
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:39,257
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1205
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,982
Your invitation, please.

1206
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:47,193
<i>Thank you sir.
The Colonel and I wish...</i>

1207
01:32:47,218 --> 01:32:49,565
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1208
01:32:49,816 --> 01:32:53,325
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1209
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:54,325
I am sorry.

1210
01:32:54,364 --> 01:32:56,966
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1211
01:32:57,982 --> 01:33:00,949
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1212
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:03,267
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1213
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:06,180
You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...

1214
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:09,669
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1215
01:33:09,694 --> 01:33:11,840
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1216
01:33:11,865 --> 01:33:13,085
And you're right master...

1217
01:33:13,525 --> 01:33:14,882
Blessing will up on us.

1218
01:33:25,425 --> 01:33:26,783
This is ridiculous.

1219
01:33:27,017 --> 01:33:29,033
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1220
01:33:29,121 --> 01:33:31,538
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1221
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:54,626
What are you supposed to be?

1222
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,797
What are you doing?

1223
01:34:24,487 --> 01:34:25,507
Excuse me.

1224
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,749
I don't drink.

1225
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:38,901
Have we met?

1226
01:34:38,926 --> 01:34:40,686
No, but I have
been watching you.

1227
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:43,428
Following your career.

1228
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:47,041
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1229
01:34:47,066 --> 01:34:49,608
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1230
01:34:50,124 --> 01:34:51,544
I am a friend.

1231
01:35:02,618 --> 01:35:04,696
I hope I'm not causing any...

1232
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:08,695
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1233
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:09,686
...very close.

1234
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:13,231
We work well together...
Yes.

1235
01:35:13,809 --> 01:35:16,798
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1236
01:35:17,554 --> 01:35:19,455
I could provide a lot more.

1237
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,248
And who are you?

1238
01:35:21,454 --> 01:35:25,538
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1239
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:34,799
I love fire. Don't you?

1240
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:38,837
It is like...

1241
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:42,593
...a living act of entropy.

1242
01:35:42,618 --> 01:35:45,233
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1243
01:35:45,918 --> 01:35:48,144
Reminding us that in the end...

1244
01:35:48,816 --> 01:35:51,982
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1245
01:35:54,488 --> 01:35:57,752
There is something reassuring about it.

1246
01:36:02,353 --> 01:36:04,466
I see all of that in your eyes.

1247
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:10,154
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1248
01:36:26,189 --> 01:36:27,807
I hear it is...

1249
01:36:30,085 --> 01:36:32,090
I hear it is extraordinary.

1250
01:36:33,055 --> 01:36:36,679
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1251
01:36:36,704 --> 01:36:39,060
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1252
01:36:39,847 --> 01:36:40,868
Besides...

1253
01:36:40,893 --> 01:36:43,533
...Now I see your
attention is...

1254
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,011
...elsewhere.

1255
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:14,047
Enjoying the party?

1256
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,874
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1257
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:21,795
A German victory, of course.

1258
01:37:22,096 --> 01:37:22,803
Victory?

1259
01:37:22,824 --> 01:37:25,525
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1260
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,829
Peace...

1261
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:28,716
is only an armistice...

1262
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:30,523
...in an endless war.

1263
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,646
Thucydides.

1264
01:37:33,053 --> 01:37:34,692
You know your ancient Greeks?

1265
01:37:34,956 --> 01:37:36,700
They understood...

1266
01:37:36,721 --> 01:37:38,164
...that war was a god.

1267
01:37:38,705 --> 01:37:41,385
A god that requires human sacrifices.

1268
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:42,650
And in exchange...

1269
01:37:42,675 --> 01:37:45,415
...war gives man purpose...

1270
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,387
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1271
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:49,790
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1272
01:37:50,525 --> 01:37:51,840
...and be courageous...

1273
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:54,054
...Noble!

1274
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:58,505
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1275
01:37:59,502 --> 01:38:01,088
And he was wrong.

1276
01:38:02,385 --> 01:38:03,770
You know nothing of the gods.

1277
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,302
<i>Herr General.</i>

1278
01:38:08,432 --> 01:38:09,986
Enjoy the fireworks.

1279
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:16,660
What are you doing?

1280
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:18,126
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1281
01:38:18,256 --> 01:38:20,093
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1282
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:21,505
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1283
01:38:21,506 --> 01:38:22,685
I will stop Ares!

1284
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,243
What if you're wrong?

1285
01:38:25,813 --> 01:38:27,415
What if there's no Ares?

1286
01:38:29,178 --> 01:38:30,629
You don't believe me.

1287
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:32,466
I can not let you do this.

1288
01:38:33,128 --> 01:38:34,586
What I do is not up to you.

1289
01:38:41,392 --> 01:38:42,545
Diana!

1290
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,821
Diana...

1291
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:49,323
The gas.

1292
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:52,338
The villagers!

1293
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:56,140
What they cheering for?

1294
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,767
Diana!

1295
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:03,766
What did they fire?

1296
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:05,080
The gas.

1297
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:07,151
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1298
01:39:07,152 --> 01:39:08,621
Wherever he goes you follow.

1299
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,855
How will you find us?

1300
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,775
I know how.

1301
01:40:30,584 --> 01:40:31,932
Diana!

1302
01:40:34,927 --> 01:40:37,589
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1303
01:40:38,505 --> 01:40:40,156
I could have saved them.

1304
01:40:40,486 --> 01:40:42,829
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1305
01:40:43,071 --> 01:40:45,047
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1306
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,636
- No!
- Get away from me!

1307
01:40:47,831 --> 01:40:49,328
I understand everything now.

1308
01:40:49,353 --> 01:40:51,139
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1309
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:52,457
It's you too.

1310
01:40:53,143 --> 01:40:54,170
All of you.

1311
01:40:55,365 --> 01:40:56,671
I'll find Ares...

1312
01:40:56,892 --> 01:40:58,456
...and I'll kill him.

1313
01:41:01,777 --> 01:41:02,912
Diana!

1314
01:41:03,955 --> 01:41:05,063
That smoke...

1315
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,202
...it's the chief!

1316
01:41:07,223 --> 01:41:08,670
He followed Ludendorff.

1317
01:41:10,161 --> 01:41:11,744
Follow the smoke!

1318
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,759
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1319
01:41:56,175 --> 01:41:57,375
Come on. Let's go!

1320
01:42:19,456 --> 01:42:21,066
Ooh, what a surprise.

1321
01:42:21,692 --> 01:42:22,984
Strange.

1322
01:42:24,363 --> 01:42:26,468
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1323
01:42:27,526 --> 01:42:28,527
...to attend to.

1324
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:36,195
What are you?

1325
01:42:36,196 --> 01:42:37,435
You will soon find out.

1326
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:15,757
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1327
01:43:19,608 --> 01:43:21,591
We'll see about that.

1328
01:43:45,946 --> 01:43:47,929
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1329
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:51,691
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1330
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:55,096
...Queen of the Amazons.

1331
01:43:57,819 --> 01:44:00,567
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1332
01:44:18,052 --> 01:44:20,551
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1333
01:44:20,802 --> 01:44:23,403
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1334
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:25,491
...by ridding this
world of you...

1335
01:44:25,746 --> 01:44:26,748
...forever!

1336
01:45:34,315 --> 01:45:35,316
Diana?

1337
01:45:41,053 --> 01:45:42,054
Diana!

1338
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:47,869
I killed him.

1339
01:45:49,498 --> 01:45:51,688
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1340
01:45:53,135 --> 01:45:55,809
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1341
01:45:56,085 --> 01:45:58,075
Exactly what we have to do now.

1342
01:45:58,257 --> 01:45:59,657
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1343
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:01,332
No. All this should
have stopped.

1344
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,300
Diana...

1345
01:46:02,302 --> 01:46:04,411
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1346
01:46:04,421 --> 01:46:06,496
I don't know! I don't know.

1347
01:46:06,717 --> 01:46:07,577
Ares is dead.

1348
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:10,810
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1349
01:46:11,018 --> 01:46:12,711
Because maybe it's them!

1350
01:46:13,131 --> 01:46:14,132
Maybe...

1351
01:46:15,968 --> 01:46:18,523
Maybe people aren't always good.

1352
01:46:19,596 --> 01:46:21,444
Ares or no Ares...

1353
01:46:22,746 --> 01:46:26,061
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1354
01:46:28,997 --> 01:46:30,288
- Diana...
- No.

1355
01:46:30,619 --> 01:46:32,071
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1356
01:46:32,276 --> 01:46:33,615
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1357
01:46:33,616 --> 01:46:35,381
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1358
01:46:35,605 --> 01:46:36,812
Can not be!

1359
01:46:37,262 --> 01:46:39,343
They were killing each other.

1360
01:46:39,595 --> 01:46:42,126
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1361
01:46:42,406 --> 01:46:43,992
Children!

1362
01:46:44,227 --> 01:46:46,573
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1363
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:49,148
Diana, people... I...

1364
01:46:49,406 --> 01:46:50,950
She was right.

1365
01:46:51,477 --> 01:46:52,486
My mother was right.

1366
01:46:52,487 --> 01:46:54,532
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1367
01:46:54,734 --> 01:46:56,428
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1368
01:46:56,674 --> 01:46:59,231
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1369
01:46:59,256 --> 01:47:01,126
Maybe we don't!

1370
01:47:02,787 --> 01:47:04,955
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1371
01:47:05,952 --> 01:47:08,766
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1372
01:47:10,251 --> 01:47:13,733
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that it was one bad guy to blame?

1373
01:47:14,364 --> 01:47:16,038
It's not!

1374
01:47:18,209 --> 01:47:19,889
We are all to blame.

1375
01:47:20,163 --> 01:47:21,164
I am not.

1376
01:47:22,773 --> 01:47:24,375
But maybe I am!

1377
01:47:28,252 --> 01:47:29,253
Please.

1378
01:47:29,614 --> 01:47:31,473
If you believe that this
war should stop...

1379
01:47:31,474 --> 01:47:33,290
...if you want to stop it...

1380
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:35,063
...help me stop it right now.

1381
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:36,371
Because, if...

1382
01:47:37,771 --> 01:47:43,076
If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1383
01:47:43,101 --> 01:47:44,584
I have to go.

1384
01:47:51,105 --> 01:47:52,718
I have to go.

1385
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:05,577
Hey!

1386
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:11,558
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1387
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:14,380
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1388
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,407
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1389
01:48:16,669 --> 01:48:19,003
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1390
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,640
How are we gonna get in there?

1391
01:48:21,371 --> 01:48:23,474
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1392
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:24,704
Come on!

1393
01:48:38,305 --> 01:48:40,050
Who's there?

1394
01:48:52,523 --> 01:48:54,433
Sir Patrick.

1395
01:48:55,142 --> 01:48:59,473
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1396
01:49:00,636 --> 01:49:04,501
They only deserve destruction.

1397
01:49:05,864 --> 01:49:07,332
You...

1398
01:49:09,006 --> 01:49:10,965
You are him.

1399
01:49:14,433 --> 01:49:15,837
I am.

1400
01:49:16,224 --> 01:49:20,850
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1401
01:49:41,494 --> 01:49:43,059
What is that?

1402
01:49:44,352 --> 01:49:45,670
Future.

1403
01:49:50,385 --> 01:49:52,391
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1404
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:58,160
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1405
01:49:58,395 --> 01:50:02,915
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1406
01:50:05,234 --> 01:50:08,904
They have always been
and always will be...

1407
01:50:09,085 --> 01:50:13,045
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1408
01:50:13,146 --> 01:50:16,420
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1409
01:50:25,706 --> 01:50:27,156
All I ever wanted was...

1410
01:50:27,157 --> 01:50:32,216
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1411
01:50:34,193 --> 01:50:35,338
But they refused.

1412
01:50:35,664 --> 01:50:36,905
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1413
01:50:37,066 --> 01:50:38,564
So I destroyed them.

1414
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:40,597
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1415
01:50:40,635 --> 01:50:42,667
...and I am here
to complete her...

1416
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,270
The God Killer...

1417
01:50:54,970 --> 01:50:56,992
My dear child...

1418
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:00,841
...that is not the God Killer.

1419
01:51:03,335 --> 01:51:04,836
You are.

1420
01:51:07,425 --> 01:51:10,563
Only a God can kill another God.

1421
01:51:11,607 --> 01:51:15,504
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazon...

1422
01:51:15,731 --> 01:51:18,004
...as a weapon to
use against me.

1423
01:51:18,029 --> 01:51:19,902
No. You liar.

1424
01:51:21,686 --> 01:51:23,999
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1425
01:51:26,302 --> 01:51:27,789
I am.

1426
01:51:54,193 --> 01:51:56,539
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1427
01:51:56,747 --> 01:51:59,215
I am the God of truth.

1428
01:52:00,748 --> 01:52:02,071
Mankind...

1429
01:52:02,705 --> 01:52:05,722
...Stole this world from us.

1430
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:11,226
They ruined it, day by day.

1431
01:52:11,227 --> 01:52:15,503
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1432
01:52:16,959 --> 01:52:19,725
...was left too weak to stop them.

1433
01:52:20,652 --> 01:52:24,278
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1434
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:26,431
...whispering into their ears.

1435
01:52:26,432 --> 01:52:31,251
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1436
01:52:32,165 --> 01:52:33,761
...weapons...

1437
01:52:36,423 --> 01:52:38,960
...but I don't
make them use them.

1438
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:41,968
They start these
wars on their own.

1439
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:46,782
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1440
01:52:47,056 --> 01:52:49,301
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1441
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:53,455
But it has never been enough.

1442
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:55,992
Until you.

1443
01:52:58,642 --> 01:53:02,896
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1444
01:53:03,474 --> 01:53:06,606
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1445
01:53:06,811 --> 01:53:10,683
...what the other
gods could not...

1446
01:53:12,057 --> 01:53:16,570
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1447
01:53:16,843 --> 01:53:20,775
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1448
01:53:20,996 --> 01:53:23,561
...destruction they bring.

1449
01:53:24,014 --> 01:53:29,147
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1450
01:53:30,751 --> 01:53:32,481
Forever.

1451
01:53:35,372 --> 01:53:36,855
I...

1452
01:53:41,651 --> 01:53:44,385
I can never be a part of that.

1453
01:53:47,507 --> 01:53:50,283
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1454
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,663
But if I must...

1455
01:54:02,256 --> 01:54:04,111
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1456
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,884
Sammy, let's go!

1457
01:54:06,324 --> 01:54:07,812
Get these things out of here.

1458
01:54:37,747 --> 01:54:42,191
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1459
01:55:07,221 --> 01:55:09,706
Oh my God!

1460
01:55:10,179 --> 01:55:11,607
What are we gonna do?

1461
01:55:13,365 --> 01:55:15,458
There is not much we can do...

1462
01:55:15,605 --> 01:55:17,234
...if that's who I think it is.

1463
01:55:22,519 --> 01:55:24,458
But we can stop that plane.

1464
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:39,560
If we could get on the radio...

1465
01:55:39,561 --> 01:55:42,146
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1466
01:55:42,171 --> 01:55:45,447
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1467
01:55:45,472 --> 01:55:46,391
We gotta ground it!

1468
01:55:46,616 --> 01:55:48,207
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1469
01:55:48,509 --> 01:55:50,667
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1470
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,644
Is it flammable, Chief?

1471
01:55:59,669 --> 01:56:03,147
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1472
01:56:10,288 --> 01:56:12,718
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1473
01:56:12,743 --> 01:56:14,895
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1474
01:56:16,917 --> 01:56:17,918
Come on!

1475
01:57:00,532 --> 01:57:02,956
Come on! This way! Steve!

1476
01:57:12,522 --> 01:57:14,369
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1477
01:57:14,783 --> 01:57:16,257
Steve!

1478
01:57:59,175 --> 01:58:02,301
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1479
01:58:28,761 --> 01:58:32,105
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1480
01:58:35,413 --> 01:58:37,169
Or you will die.

1481
01:58:47,232 --> 01:58:49,584
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1482
01:58:52,766 --> 01:58:54,764
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1483
01:59:19,824 --> 01:59:22,569
Is that all you have to offer?

1484
01:59:38,865 --> 01:59:42,786
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1485
01:59:43,623 --> 01:59:45,332
Give up, Diana.

1486
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,022
Chief! Anything left?

1487
01:59:51,047 --> 01:59:51,982
I got nothing.

1488
01:59:52,007 --> 01:59:53,313
- Anything!
- No!

1489
02:00:11,153 --> 02:00:12,154
Steve.

1490
02:00:58,629 --> 02:01:00,081
Steve.

1491
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:06,979
No!

1492
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:42,801
Yes, Diana!

1493
02:01:43,203 --> 02:01:45,769
Take them all!

1494
02:01:46,114 --> 02:01:49,200
Finally you see.

1495
02:01:49,624 --> 02:01:52,199
Look at this world.

1496
02:01:52,498 --> 02:01:55,314
Mankind did this, not me.

1497
02:01:57,099 --> 02:01:59,172
They are ugly...

1498
02:01:59,197 --> 02:02:01,011
...filled with hatred...

1499
02:02:01,312 --> 02:02:02,395
...weak.

1500
02:02:02,796 --> 02:02:05,596
Just like your
Captain Trevor.

1501
02:02:06,088 --> 02:02:11,802
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1502
02:02:12,189 --> 02:02:13,774
Pathetic!

1503
02:02:15,148 --> 02:02:16,891
He deserved to burn!

1504
02:02:27,901 --> 02:02:32,037
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1505
02:02:40,444 --> 02:02:44,443
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1506
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:50,106
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1507
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:53,757
Destroy her, Diana.

1508
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,240
You know that she deserves it.
They all do.

1509
02:03:01,421 --> 02:03:02,781
Do it!

1510
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:09,292
Diana!

1511
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:13,935
Diana...

1512
02:03:23,465 --> 02:03:24,466
What?

1513
02:03:24,966 --> 02:03:26,570
We have to go.

1514
02:03:29,316 --> 02:03:30,809
What are you saying?

1515
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:32,421
Steve...

1516
02:03:33,253 --> 02:03:35,385
Whatever it is, I can do it.

1517
02:03:35,711 --> 02:03:36,559
No.. No..

1518
02:03:36,686 --> 02:03:38,075
- Let me do it.
- No.

1519
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,952
It has to be me.

1520
02:03:39,977 --> 02:03:41,631
It has to be me.

1521
02:03:41,951 --> 02:03:45,199
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1522
02:03:54,017 --> 02:03:56,457
I wish we had more time.

1523
02:03:56,702 --> 02:03:59,481
What?
What are you saying?

1524
02:04:02,389 --> 02:04:03,390
I love you!

1525
02:04:15,332 --> 02:04:16,815
You are wrong about them.

1526
02:04:26,587 --> 02:04:28,250
They are everything you say...

1527
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:30,707
...but so much more.

1528
02:04:30,977 --> 02:04:32,274
Lies!

1529
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:02,150
They do not deserve
your protection!

1530
02:05:03,926 --> 02:05:05,013
It's not about deserving.

1531
02:05:09,888 --> 02:05:11,792
It's about what you believe.

1532
02:05:15,428 --> 02:05:16,808
And I believe in love.

1533
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:22,089
Then I will destroy you!

1534
02:05:49,307 --> 02:05:51,036
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1535
02:09:23,204 --> 02:09:25,597
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1536
02:09:26,686 --> 02:09:30,427
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1537
02:09:31,181 --> 02:09:35,056
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1538
02:09:35,905 --> 02:09:38,170
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1539
02:09:38,885 --> 02:09:41,171
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1540
02:09:41,877 --> 02:09:44,733
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1541
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,429
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat.</i>

1542
02:09:49,775 --> 02:09:51,019
<i>And now I know...</i>

1543
02:09:52,191 --> 02:09:56,734
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1544
02:09:58,456 --> 02:10:00,159
<i>So I stay...</i>

1545
02:10:00,426 --> 02:10:02,580
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1546
02:10:05,568 --> 02:10:07,544
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1547
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:13,788
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1548
02:10:16,659 --> 02:10:18,002
<i>Forever.</i>
