1
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,246
MANUEL.

2
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,373
MANUEL!

3
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,306
MANUEL.

4
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,613
I THINK...

5
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,993
I THINK I FOUND YOU ONE.

6
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,583
LOOK, I CALLED YOU, RIGHT?

7
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:14,964
SOON AS I COULDN'T PULL IT OUT MYSELF,
I CALLED YOU, JOHN.

8
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,982
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE HAD TO TIE HER DOWN, OKAY?

9
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,026
IT'S OKAY.

10
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,915
THIS IS CONSTANTINE.

11
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:36,212
JOHN CONSTANTINE, ASSHOLE.

12
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,721
SURE.

13
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,912
WHAT THE HELL?

14
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,890
I NEED A MIRROR.

15
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,184
NOW. AT LEAST 3 FEET HIGH.

16
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,603
MOVE! GO, NOW!

17
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,912
THIS IS KRAMER.

18
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,457
CHAS KRAMER, ASSHOLE.

19
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,334
ASSHOLE.

20
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,714
WHAT? OH, THIS IS KRAMER.
CHAS KRAMER, ASSHOLE.

21
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,008
CHAS!
WHAT?

22
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,928
MOVE THE CAR.
WHY?

23
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,889
MOVE THE DAMN CAR!

24
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,310
"CHAS, MOVE THE CAR."

25
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,855
THERE, CAR'S MOVED.

26
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,993
LIFT IT UP OVER THE BED.

27
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:37,083
TIE THAT END OFF.
HENNESSY, OVER THE TOP.

28
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:43,756
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS, DON'T LOOK.

29
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,936
NO!

30
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,195
SHOW YOURSELF.

31
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,326
SMILE PRETTY, YOU VAIN PRICK.

32
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:21,919
FOR YOUR BOSS.

33
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,297
PULL IT!

34
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,701
MA? MA?

35
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:34,075
LIKE I SAID, I FOUND YOU SOMETHING,
DIDN'T I, JOHN? DIDN'T I?

36
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,910
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?

37
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,586
GOING TO A LOT OF MEETINGS, I SEE.

38
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,880
KEEPS THE VOICES OUT SO I CAN SLEEP.

39
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,509
I HAVE TO SLEEP, JOHN.

40
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,720
I NEED SOME HELP, FATHER.

41
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,014
YOU DO?

42
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,933
FROM ME?

43
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,810
WHAT KIND OF...?

44
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,233
HEY, LISTEN, I...
THAT EXORCISM WASN'T RIGHT.

45
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,071
LISTEN TO THE ETHER.

46
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,659
ANYTHING UNUSUAL, YOU LET ME KNOW.

47
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:22,206
COME ON, YOU DON'T NEED ITS PROTECTION.
IT'LL BE LIKE BACK IN THE DAY.

48
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,586
A FEW DAYS.

49
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,088
OKAY.

50
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,675
OKAY. FOR YOU, JOHN.

51
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,640
JOHN, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
IF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MY CAR?

52
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:42,393
I TOLD YOU TO MOVE IT.
YOU DID TELL ME TO MOVE IT...

53
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,063
BUT IF YOU'D SAID YOU WERE DROPPING
A 300-POUND MIRROR WITH A DEMON...

54
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,065
I WOULD'VE MOVED IT FURTHER, JOHN.

55
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,902
TAKE ALVARADO.
YEAH, THANK YOU. I KNOW WHAT TO TAKE.

56
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,949
YOU EVER THINK IF YOU TOLD ME MORE NOW
THAT MAYBE I COULD HELP OUT?

57
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,450
NO?
NOPE.

58
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,952
NOPE?

59
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,204
OF COURSE IT'S A NOPE.

60
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:40,868
BLESS ME, FATHER, FOR I HAVE SINNED.

61
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,123
<i>IT'S BEEN...</i>

62
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,336
<i>TWO WEEKS SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.</i>

63
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,883
I KILLED A MAN TODAY.

64
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,677
ANOTHER ONE.

65
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:08,103
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIS FACE, I JUST...

66
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,523
PULLED THE TRIGGER, AND HE WENT AWAY.

67
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:18,906
<i>MOST COPS GO 20 YEARS
WITHOUT FIRING THEIR GUNS.</i>

68
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:24,161
<i>WHY DO I ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE THESE GUYS ARE?</i>

69
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,665
WHERE TO AIM, WHEN TO FIRE.

70
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,253
<i>I'M WONDERING, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME, FATHER?</i>

71
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,089
<i>SOMETHING DAMNED?</i>

72
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:40,594
<i>GOD HAS A PLAN FOR YOU.
HE HAS A PLAN FOR US ALL.</i>

73
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,182
<i>YOU MUSTN'T LET YOUR FAITH
BE OVERSHADOWED BY GUILT.</i>

74
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,393
YEAH, I 'M TRYING.

75
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,646
<i>I'M TRYING REAL HARD.</i>

76
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,565
ISABEL.

77
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,785
<i>ISABEL.</i>

78
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,719
THINGS I'VE BEATEN.

79
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,598
THINGS MOST PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

80
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,185
AND NOW I'M GONNA BE DONE IN BY THIS.

81
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,647
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST, JOHN.

82
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,567
COME ON, LES.

83
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,070
YOU SAVED ME BEFORE,
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN, RIGHT?

84
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,115
THIS IS AGGRESSIVE.

85
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,369
TWENTY YEARS AGO,
YOU DIDN'T WANNA BE HERE.

86
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,539
NOW YOU DON'T WANNA LEAVE.

87
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,375
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

88
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,338
JOHN, YOU REALLY NEED TO PREPARE.

89
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,887
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.
NO NEED.

90
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,224
I ALREADY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I'M GOING.

91
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,188
MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

92
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,316
GOOD MORNING.
DETECTIVE.

93
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,318
NO, NO, NO.
ANGELA, WAIT.

94
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,155
YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS, OKAY? NO.

95
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,824
GIVE US THE ROOM, PLEASE.

96
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,107
ISABEL.

97
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,116
SHE FELL FROM THE ROOF?

98
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,118
SHE JUMPED.

99
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,872
NO.
LOOK...

100
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,210
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT.
SHE WAS SICK.

101
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,263
ISABEL WOULDN'T KILL HERSELF.
ANGIE.

102
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,974
SHE WOULDN'T KILL HERSELF.
DETECTIVE.

103
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,476
PERIOD.
DETECTIVE.

104
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,269
PERIOD!

105
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:04,024
ANGIE, THERE WERE SECURITY CAMERAS.

106
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,828
HOLD THE DOOR. YOU GOING DOWN?
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

107
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,131
A NEW CASE?

108
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:15,053
THE BIG SCORE? THE MOTHER LODE?
THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR?

109
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,265
HUMOR ME.
DON'T I ALWAYS?

110
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,857
OH, YEAH, THAT'S...
MUCH OBLIGED. THANK YOU.

111
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,569
HOW YOU FEELING, JOHN?

112
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,404
SO, WHAT'S NEW?

113
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,116
UH...

114
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,454
BULLET SHAVINGS FROM
THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON THE POPE...

115
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,249
HOLY-WATER AMPOULES
FROM THE RIVER JORDAN...

116
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:49,338
AND... OH, YOU'LL LOVE THIS.
SCREECH BEETLE FROM AMITYVILLE.

117
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,594
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY TO YOU, BUT TO THE
FALLEN, THAT'S LIKE NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.

118
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,889
WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY, WITH YOU AND BUGS?

119
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,975
I JUST LIKE THEM.

120
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,019
YEAH. WHO DOESN'T?

121
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,231
YEAH, EASY THERE, HERO.

122
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,985
THAT'S DRAGON'S BREATH.
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T GET IT ANYMORE.

123
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,654
YEAH, WELL, I...

124
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,948
KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY.

125
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,708
SO, WHAT'S THE ACTION?

126
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,962
I JUST PULLED A SOLDIER DEMON
OUT OF A LITTLE GIRL.

127
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,216
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS TRYING
TO COME THROUGH.

128
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,260
YEAH, I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS.

129
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,721
NO, WE'RE FINGER PUPPETS
TO THEM, JOHN...

130
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,264
NOT DOORWAYS.

131
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,519
THEY CAN WORK US, BUT THEY CAN'T
COME THROUGH ONTO OUR PLANE.

132
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,313
CHECK THE SCROLLS ANYWAY.
SEE IF THERE'S ANY PRECEDENT.

133
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,982
SURE THING, JOHN. UH...

134
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,151
ANYTHING ELSE?

135
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,363
WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
ANYTHING FOR A, UH...?

136
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,366
ON THE HOUSE.

137
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,870
ALL RIGHT, QUESTION. HOW MUCH
LONGER DO I HAVE TO BE YOUR SLAVE, JOHN?

138
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,999
YOU'RE NOT MY SLAVE, CHAS.

139
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,878
YOU'RE MY VERY APPRECIATED APPRENTICE.

140
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,214
LIKE TONTO OR ROBIN.

141
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,092
OR THAT SKINNY FELLOW
WITH THE FAT FRIEND.

142
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,138
RIGHT. SO THEN WHY DON'T I APPRENTICE
SOMETHING BESIDES DRIVING, THEN, JOHN?

143
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,726
JOHN? JOHN.

144
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,646
I LOVE OUR LITTLE TALKS, JOHN.

145
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,078
MAY I TAKE YOUR COAT, MR. CONSTANTINE?

146
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,039
NO, THANKS,
I'M NOT GONNA BE STAYING LONG.

147
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,794
HOW ABOUT YOU, MA'AM?
OH, NO, I'M NOT STAYING LONG EITHER.

148
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,464
I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

149
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,341
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.

150
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:04,598
OH. SO YOU'RE RUDE
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.

151
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,192
FATHER.
HI.

152
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,779
YOU HAVE NEWS.
YES, I SPOKE WITH THE BISHOP.

153
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,864
YES.

154
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,163
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, SON.

155
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,875
STILL KEEPING YOUR ALL-SEEING EYE
ON ME, GABRIEL?

156
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,462
I'M FLATTERED.

157
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,882
WELL, I COULD OFFER SOMETHING...

158
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,303
ABOUT HOW A SHEPHERD LEADS
EVEN THE MOST WAYWARD OF HIS FLOCK...

159
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,555
BUT IT MIGHT SOUND DISINGENUOUS.

160
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,475
SHE HAS TO HAVE A CATHOLIC FUNERAL,
FATHER. SHE HAS TO.

161
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,854
ANGELA, IT'S STILL CONSIDERED A MORTAL SIN.
SHE DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE.

162
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,649
THE BISHOP BELIEVES OTHERWISE.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

163
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,901
OH, RULES.

164
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,903
FATHER.

165
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,655
DAVID.

166
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,242
THIS IS ISABEL.

167
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,162
GOD WAS THE ONLY ONE
SHE EVER BELIEVED LOVED HER.

168
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,790
PLEASE.

169
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,376
I'M SORRY.

170
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,715
I'VE BEEN SEEING SOME
UNUSUAL SOUL TRAFFIC LATELY.

171
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,635
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
GIVING ME AN EXTENSION.

172
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,388
I COULD DO YOUR SIDE SOME GOOD
THESE DAYS.

173
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,807
YOU STILL TRYING TO BUY YOUR WAY
INTO HEAVEN?

174
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,727
WHAT ABOUT THE MINIONS
I'VE SENT BACK?

175
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:37,065
THAT ALONE SHOULD GUARANTEE MY ENTRY.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU?

176
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,234
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS WORKS.

177
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,112
WHY, HAVEN'T I SERVED HIM ENOUGH?

178
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,032
WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM ME?
ONLY THE USUAL.

179
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,286
SELF-SACRIFICE, BELIEF.

180
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,664
OH, I BELIEVE, FOR CHRISSAKE.
NO, NO, YOU KNOW.

181
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,083
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. YOU'VE SEEN.

182
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,921
I NEVER ASKED TO SEE.
I WAS BORN WITH THIS CURSE.

183
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,173
A GIFT, JOHN.

184
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,843
ONE THAT YOU'VE SQUANDERED
ON SELFISH ENDEAVORS.

185
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,555
I'M PULLING DEMONS OUT OF LITTLE GIRLS.

186
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,557
WHO'S THAT FOR?

187
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,270
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE,
YOU'VE ONLY EVER DONE FOR YOURSELF.

188
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,689
TO EARN YOUR WAY
BACK INTO HIS GOOD GRACES.

189
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,483
IMPOSSIBLE RULES, ENDLESS REGULATIONS...

190
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,612
WHO GOES UP, WHO GOES DOWN
AND WHY.

191
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,870
YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND US.

192
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,165
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD GO
TO HELL, HALF-BREED.

193
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,888
WHY ME, GABRIEL?

194
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,725
IT'S PERSONAL, ISN'T IT?

195
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:59,606
I DIDN'T GO TO CHURCH ENOUGH,
I DIDN'T PRAY ENOUGH...

196
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,235
I WAS 5 BUCKS SHORT
IN THE COLLECTION PLATE. WHY?

197
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,990
YOU ARE GOING TO DIE YOUNG...

198
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:13,078
BECAUSE YOU SMOKED 30 CIGARETTES
A DAY SINCE YOU WERE 15.

199
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,122
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO HELL...

200
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:19,334
BECAUSE OF THE LIFE YOU TOOK.

201
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,216
YOU'RE FUCKED.

202
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,271
AT LEAST IT'S NICE OUT.

203
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,152
HE ALWAYS HAD A ROTTEN SENSE OF HUMOR.

204
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,370
AND HIS PUNCH LINES ARE KILLERS.

205
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,044
JOHN!

206
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,382
CONSTANTINE, IT'S RAINING! JOHN! HEY!

207
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,565
<i>TWENTY-TWO WOMEN WERE FOUND
BURIED IN THE ASSAILANT'S BACK YARD.</i>

208
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:27,444
<i>SO MUCH DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE
TO THE BODIES, POLICE HAD TO MATCH...</i>

209
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,071
<i>POLICE REPORT SHE HAD BEEN
PHYSICALLY PENETRATED...</i>

210
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,991
<i>OVER 100 TIMES AND BURIED ALIVE.</i>

211
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:36,911
<i>FOUND LOCKED IN A FREEZER,
HIS HEAD SEVERED AND HIS ORGANS...</i>

212
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,872
<i>HE STUFFED HOLLY'S BODY INTO...</i>

213
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,043
<i>THE BODIES RAVISHED...
HE USED A SMALL HANDSAW...</i>

214
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,671
<i>HAD NEARLY DECAPITATED...
EVEN HIS EYES WERE GOUGED OUT.</i>

215
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,506
ISABEL.

216
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,574
I'M SO SORRY, IZZY.

217
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,826
<i>CONSTANTINE.</i>

218
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,821
DODSON.

219
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,781
HELLO?

220
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,242
HELLO.

221
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,499
HELLO?

222
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,939
HEY. HEY, BUDDY, GOT A LIGHT?

223
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,432
SHOULD'VE MINDED
YOUR OWN BUSINESS, EXORCIST.

224
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,292
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING, JOHN.
YOU'RE GOING TO MIDNITE'S.

225
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,127
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT IN THE CAB.

226
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:17,090
IT'S A HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO RISE AND FALL.
I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THIS, JOHN.

227
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,009
YOU READ TOO MUCH, KID. IT'S A BAR.
IT'S A BAR?

228
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:24,555
IT'S A BAR. PAPA MIDNITE IS A CRUSADER FOR
GOOD. HE SWORE THE OATH OF NEUTRALITY.

229
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,350
JOHN, THE MAN'S A LEGEND.
YEAH.

230
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,019
CAN YOU PLEASE GET ME
INTO THIS BAR, JOHN, PLEASE?

231
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,729
I'M BEGGING YOU, JOHN, PLEASE?

232
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,066
SURE, YOU CAN GET IN.
I CAN GET IN?

233
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,443
IF YOU CAN GET IN.

234
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,906
IF I CAN GET...? IT'S A BEAR, THOUGH,
RIGHT? OR TWO DUCKS IN A CLOUD?

235
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,662
TWO FROGS ON A BENCH.

236
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,960
TWO FROGS ON A BENCH.

237
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,129
NO, NO, I'M WITH THE GUY YOU JUST...

238
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,172
JOHN! JOHN!

239
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,341
I'M WITH HIM, THOUGH.

240
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,428
RAT IN A DRESS.

241
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,973
OF COURSE IT IS. RAT IN A DRESS.

242
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,100
I'M JUST TESTING. I'M JUST TESTING.

243
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,239
DON'T GET UP.

244
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,910
YOU'VE BEEN ABSENT SOME TIME.

245
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,080
HAVE YOU COME HERE WITH RELICS TO SELL?

246
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:15,666
NO, I'M OUT OF THAT NOW.
I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY.

247
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,712
PERHAPS PEDDLING FORGERIES HAS ENDED UP
BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

248
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,839
MIDNITE, JESUS...

249
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,426
I THOUGHT THE THING WAS AUTHENTIC.

250
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,056
I SEE NOW.

251
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,559
YOUR HEALTH IS BAD FOR OTHER REASONS.
HOW LONG?

252
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,520
A FEW MONTHS, MAYBE A YEAR.

253
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,356
I THOUGHT I HEARD THUNDER LAST NIGHT.

254
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:41,651
MUST HAVE BEEN
SATAN'S STOMACH GROWLING.

255
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,947
YOU'RE THE ONE SOUL HE'D COME
UP HERE HIMSELF TO COLLECT.

256
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,449
SO I'VE HEARD.

257
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,911
WELL, I AM MOST CERTAIN
YOU DID NOT COME HERE...

258
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,248
FOR A SYMPATHETIC SHOULDER
TO CRY ON.

259
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:01,337
A DEMON JUST ATTACKED ME,
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN ON FIGUEROA.

260
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,756
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU, JOHN.

261
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,800
HOW MANY HAVE YOU
DEPORTED BACK TO HELL?

262
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:10,513
NOT SOME ANGRY HALF-BREED, MIDNITE.
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON, HERE, ON OUR PLANE.

263
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,433
CLEARLY I DO NOT HAVE TO REMIND YOU
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

264
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,935
AND YESTERDAY I SAW A SOLDIER DEMON...

265
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,604
TRYING TO CHEW ITS WAY OUT
THROUGH A LITTLE GIRL.

266
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:23,526
LISTEN, JOHN, DEMONS STAY IN HELL,
ANGELS IN HEAVEN...

267
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:26,237
THE GREAT DÉTENTE
OF THE ORIGINAL SUPERPOWERS.

268
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:31,325
THANKS FOR THE HISTORY LESSON, MIDNITE.
YOU'VE BEEN A TREMENDOUS HELP.

269
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,077
NOW...

270
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,706
I NEED TO USE THE CHAIR.

271
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:44,505
JOHN, FORGETTING THE FACT THAT IT WOULD
ALMOST CERTAINLY KILL YOU...

272
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,382
YOU KNOW I AM NEUTRAL.

273
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,803
AND AS LONG AS THE BALANCE
IS MAINTAINED, I TAKE NO SIDES.

274
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:54,599
BEFORE YOU WERE A BARTENDER...

275
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:59,145
YOU WERE ONE WITCH DOCTOR
AGAINST, WHAT, 30 ASHGAR?

276
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,024
AND I...
YOU WERE CONSTANTINE.

277
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:06,569
THE JOHN CONSTANTINE.

278
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,030
ONCE.

279
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,784
THIS ISN'T THE USUAL GAME, I CAN FEEL IT.

280
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,370
SOMETHING'S COMING.

281
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,165
OOH, SPOOKY.

282
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,167
BALTHAZAR.

283
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:25,421
THAT EXPRESSION ALONE
HAS MADE MY ENTIRE NIGHT.

284
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,548
I'LL MAKE YOUR NIGHT.

285
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:31,427
I'LL DEPORT YOUR SORRY ASS RIGHT WHERE
YOU STAND, YOU HALF-BREED SHIT!

286
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:37,934
YOU KNOW THE RULES OF MY HOUSE.
WHILE HERE, YOU WILL ABIDE BY THEM.

287
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,061
JOHNNY BOY.

288
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:46,734
WORD IS YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY DOWN.

289
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,111
FRESH MEAT.

290
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,742
FINGER-LICKING GOOD.

291
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,911
WE HAVE A MEETING NOW, JOHN.

292
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,213
WHAT? I DIDN'T CATCH THAT.

293
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,009
WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

294
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,894
MR. CONSTANTINE.

295
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,441
I SAW YOU...
I REMEMBER.

296
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:12,069
AND THEN I SAW YOU AT THE...
REGULAR KISMET.

297
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,782
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS,
IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY.

298
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:20,036
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE TALKING MOOD
RIGHT NOW.

299
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,872
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD JUST LISTEN THEN.

300
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,166
PLEASE?

301
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:30,963
ALWAYS A CATCH.

302
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,522
MY SISTER WAS MURDERED YESTERDAY.

303
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,651
SORRY TO HEAR.
THANKS.

304
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:56,906
SHE WAS A PATIENT AT RAVENSCAR.
SHE JUMPED OFF THE ROOF.

305
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,533
THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WAS MURDERED.

306
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,703
YEAH, WELL, ISABEL WOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN HER OWN LIFE.

307
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,540
YEAH, WHAT KIND OF MENTAL PATIENT
KILLS HERSELF?

308
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,627
THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

309
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:17,510
LOOK, I'VE HEARD YOUR NAME
AROUND THE PRECINCT.

310
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:22,890
I KNOW THE CIRCLES YOU TRAVEL IN.
THE OCCULT, DEMONOLOGY, EXORCISMS.

311
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:26,686
JUST BEFORE MY SISTER WAS COMMITTED,
SHE BECAME DEEPLY PARANOID.

312
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:31,565
SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT DEMONS,
ANGELS.

313
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,485
NOW, I THINK SOMEONE GOT TO HER,
MR. CONSTANTINE.

314
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:38,447
I THINK THEY BRAINWASHED HER
INTO STEPPING OFF THAT ROOF.

315
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:43,077
SOME KIND OF LEGION OR CULT.

316
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,205
SOUNDS LIKE A THEORY, DETECTIVE.

317
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,790
GOOD LUCK.

318
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,670
I THOUGHT WITH YOUR BACKGROUND,
YOU COULD AT LEAST...

319
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,505
POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

320
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,007
YEAH, OKAY, SURE.

321
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,346
IT WASN'T A SUICIDE.

322
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,682
MY SISTER WAS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC.

323
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,351
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
IF SHE TOOK HER OWN LIFE...

324
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,312
HER SOUL WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO HELL...

325
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:15,609
WHERE SHE'D BE RIPPED APART OVER
AND OVER IN SCREAMING, BRUTAL AGONY...

326
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:19,029
FOR ALL ETERNITY. THAT IT?

327
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,240
THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

328
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,332
GODDAMN YOU.

329
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,156
DETECTIVE.

330
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,159
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT GOD
AND THE DEVIL MADE A WAGER...

331
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,829
A KIND OF STANDING BET
FOR THE SOULS OF ALL MANKIND?

332
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,499
I'D TELL YOU TO STAY ON YOUR MEDS.

333
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:15,961
HUMOR ME. NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH
HUMANS. THAT WOULD BE THE RULE.

334
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:20,508
JUST INFLUENCE. SEE WHO WOULD WIN.
OKAY, I'M HUMORING YOU.

335
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,760
WHY?
WHO KNOWS.

336
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:26,013
MAYBE JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT. NO TELLING.
OH, SO IT'S FUN.

337
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,185
IT'S FUN WHEN A MAN BEATS HIS WIFE TO
DEATH, WHEN A MOTHER DROWNS HER BABY.

338
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:35,105
AND YOU THINK THE DEVIL IS RESPONSIBLE?

339
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:38,025
PEOPLE ARE EVIL, MR. CONSTANTINE. PEOPLE.

340
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,654
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE BORN
CAPABLE OF TERRIBLE THINGS.

341
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:45,574
THEN SOMETIMES SOMETHING ELSE COMES
ALONG AND GIVES US JUST THE RIGHT NUDGE.

342
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:49,203
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN REAL EDUCATIONAL...

343
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,080
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE DEVIL.

344
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,708
YOU SHOULD. HE BELIEVES IN YOU.

345
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,064
IT'S A POWER OUTAGE.

346
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,191
NOT LIKELY.

347
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,239
WHAT?
WE SHOULD GO. NOW.

348
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,371
WHAT IS THAT?

349
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,207
WINGS.

350
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,127
MAYBE TALONS.

351
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,171
YOU'RE KIDDING. OF WHAT?

352
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,175
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

353
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,724
THAT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO HELP.

354
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,981
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
WHY?

355
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,482
SUIT YOURSELF.

356
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,133
DEMONS STAY IN HELL, HUH?

357
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,303
TELL THEM THAT.

358
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,560
DON'T WORRY. HAPPENS TO EVERYONE
THE FIRST TIME.

359
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,854
IT'S THE SULFUR.

360
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,440
SULFUR.

361
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,070
WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS?

362
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,114
DEMONS.

363
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:55,329
SCAVENGERS OF THE DAMNED.
NO, NO. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

364
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:59,291
YEAH. AND I DON'T THINK
THEY WERE AFTER ME.

365
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,463
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
SHE WOULDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE.

366
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,048
ISABEL?

367
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,926
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.

368
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,387
WELL, LET'S BE SURE.

369
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,098
LET'S SEE IF SHE'S IN HELL.

370
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,749
OH, WAS IT SUPPOSED TO BE HOT OR COLD?

371
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,377
IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR.

372
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,090
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS.

373
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,884
THESE ARE ALL ISABEL'S THINGS?
YEAH.

374
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,929
HOW ABOUT THE CAT?
DUCK?

375
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,724
YEAH, WHY?

376
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,101
DUCK.

377
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,603
OH, YOU THINK THAT'S STRANGE.

378
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,230
CATS ARE GOOD.

379
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,024
HALF IN, HALF OUT ANYWAY.

380
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,545
IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF SPELL
OR SOMETHING...

381
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,882
DON'T YOU NEED CANDLES
AND A PENTAGRAM FOR IT TO WORK?

382
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,384
WHY. DO YOU HAVE ANY?

383
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,637
THIS IS CRAZY.
YES.

384
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,518
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

385
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,189
I'M SORRY?
ANGELA, PLEASE.

386
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,487
THE APARTMENT.

387
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,324
OKAY.

388
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,665
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT CAT.

389
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:11,048
GOD, I HATE THIS PART.

390
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,673
ISABEL. CONSTANTINE.

391
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,637
ANGELA.

392
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,642
JESUS.

393
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,606
CONSTANTINE, WHAT...?
TWINS.

394
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,692
JESUS. WHAT?

395
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,112
YOU WERE TWINS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

396
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:22,948
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
WHAT?

397
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:26,702
AND SHE'S DAMNED FOR IT.

398
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,425
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

399
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,804
I NEED TO EAT.

400
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,039
HEY! HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

401
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:40,961
RELAX, MAN.

402
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,380
SLOW DOWN!

403
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,531
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?

404
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,917
JOHN.

405
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:36,243
WHEN I WAS A KID, I COULD SEE THINGS.

406
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,787
THINGS HUMANS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE.

407
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:43,250
<i>THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE.</i>

408
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,146
MY PARENTS WERE NORMAL.
THEY DID WHAT MOST PARENTS WOULD DO.

409
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,816
<i>THEY MADE IT WORSE.</i>

410
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:13,071
YOU THINK YOU'RE CRAZY LONG ENOUGH...

411
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,864
YOU FIND A WAY OUT.

412
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:19,119
<i>YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF.
I DIDN'T TRY ANYTHING.</i>

413
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:26,001
<i>OFFICIALLY, I WAS DEAD FOR TWO MINUTES.</i>

414
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,296
BUT WHEN YOU CROSS OVER...

415
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,799
TIME STOPS.

416
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:37,095
TAKE IT FROM ME,
TWO MINUTES IN HELL IS A LIFETIME.

417
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:41,308
WHEN I CAME BACK...

418
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,020
I KNEW...

419
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,106
ALL THE THINGS I COULD SEE WERE REAL.

420
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:54,571
HEAVEN AND HELL ARE RIGHT HERE.
BEHIND EVERY WALL, EVERY WINDOW.

421
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:59,743
THE WORLD BEHIND THE WORLD,
AND WE'RE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE.

422
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:03,455
ANGELS AND DEMONS CAN'T
CROSS OVER ONTO OUR PLANE.

423
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:06,541
SO INSTEAD WE GET
WHAT I CALL HALF-BREEDS.

424
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,919
<i>THE INFLUENCE PEDDLERS.</i>

425
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:15,550
<i>THEY CAN ONLY WHISPER IN OUR EARS, BUT
A SINGLE WORD CAN GIVE YOU COURAGE...</i>

426
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:19,763
<i>OR TURN YOUR FAVORITE PLEASURE
INTO YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.</i>

427
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:22,974
<i>THOSE WITH THE DEMON'S TOUCH...</i>

428
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:28,188
<i>LIKE THOSE PART ANGEL,
LIVING ALONGSIDE US.</i>

429
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:30,857
THEY CALL IT THE BALANCE.

430
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,402
I CALL IT HYPOCRITICAL BULLSHIT.

431
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,531
SO WHEN A HALF-BREED
BREAKS THE RULES...

432
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:42,994
I DEPORT THEIR SORRY ASS
STRAIGHT BACK TO HELL.

433
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,247
I DON'T GET THEM ALL...

434
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:50,710
BUT I'VE BEEN HOPING TO GET ENOUGH
TO ENSURE MY...

435
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,714
RETIREMENT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

436
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:58,885
I'M A SUICIDE, ANGELA.

437
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:02,597
WHEN I DIE, THE RULES SAY
I'VE GOT JUST ONE PLACE TO GO.

438
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,808
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY YOUR WAY
INTO HEAVEN.

439
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,519
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE SENTENCED TO A PRISON...

440
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:10,021
WHERE HALF THE INMATES
WERE PUT THERE BY YOU?

441
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,943
I GUESS GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ALL OF US.

442
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,488
GOD'S A KID WITH AN ANT FARM, LADY.

443
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:20,699
HE'S NOT PLANNING ANYTHING.

444
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:23,076
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE...

445
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:26,663
ISABEL SAW THINGS TOO.

446
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:33,503
DODSON.

447
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:39,592
GUARD SPOTTED HIM GROPING
THE BODY, THEN HE RAN ACROSS THE STREET.

448
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:42,846
CAME IN HERE, AND HE HAD A GO
AT THE ENTIRE STOCK.

449
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,266
HE DROWNED HIMSELF IN ALCOHOL
IN UNDER A MINUTE.

450
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,477
COULD'VE BEEN A MEMBER
OF MY FRATERNITY.

451
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,898
HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE?

452
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,692
HE'S OKAY.

453
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,788
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH?

454
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,158
YES?

455
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:47,952
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

456
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,371
WHAT?

457
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:52,081
HOW?

458
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:02,008
MM-HM.

459
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,721
GOT IT. BYE.

460
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:16,231
I NEED TO SEE WHERE ISABEL DIED.

461
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,567
<i>SÉANCES, OUIJA BOARDS, CHANNELING.</i>

462
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:23,780
OUR FATHER THOUGHT SHE WAS
JUST TRYING TO GET ATTENTION.

463
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,491
SHE CERTAINLY DID THAT.

464
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:30,203
SHE'D TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THE THINGS
SHE SAID SHE SAW.

465
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:34,082
SHE'D SCARE MY MOTHER HALF TO DEATH.

466
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,545
AND THEN SHE STOPPED TALKING
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

467
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,964
SO YOU HAD HER COMMITTED.

468
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,465
YEAH.

469
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,300
HOW LONG?

470
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:46,386
TWO WEEKS.

471
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,638
THIS TIME.

472
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:53,393
SHE'D GET BETTER, AND THEN SHE'D
GET WORSE. RECENTLY, A LOT WORSE.

473
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:59,023
THAT SYMBOL THAT WAS CUT
IN THE DEAD GUY'S HAND...

474
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,484
DOES IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THIS?

475
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,070
I'M A COP, JOHN, REMEMBER?

476
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:09,200
YOU DON'T WALK OFF THE ROOF OF A BUILDING
WITHOUT LEAVING SOMETHING BEHIND.

477
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:14,247
AND I SHOWED YOU EVERYTHING
SHE LEFT BEHIND IN THAT BOX, BUT FEEL FREE.

478
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:19,752
MAYBE SHE LEFT SOMETHING ELSE.
NOT SOMETHING A COP WOULD FIND.

479
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:23,089
SOMETHING JUST FOR YOU.

480
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:28,803
YOU WERE HER TWIN, ANGELA.
TWINS TEND TO THINK ALIKE.

481
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,307
I'M NOT LIKE MY SISTER.
BUT YOU WERE ONCE.

482
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,684
WHEN YOU WERE KIDS.

483
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:37,770
WHEN YOU'D SPEND EVERY SECOND
WITH EACH OTHER.

484
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:41,691
YOU'D START A SENTENCE, SHE'D FINISH IT.
YOU'D GET HURT, SHE'D CW.

485
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,318
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

486
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,445
THAT KIND OF BOND DOESN'T
JUST DISAPPEAR.

487
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:47,697
THERE IS NOTHING HERE.

488
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,451
HEY. COME ON.
SHE PLANNED HER DEATH IN THIS ROOM.

489
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:55,038
SHE THOUGHT IT UP RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

490
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:58,458
SHE KNEW YOU'D COME. SHE COUNTED
ON YOU TO SEE WHAT SHE SAW...

491
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,669
FEEL WHAT SHE FELT,
KNOW WHAT SHE KNEW.

492
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,672
WHAT DID SHE DO, ANGELA?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

493
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,258
WHAT DID SHE DO, ANGELA?
I DON'T KNOW.

494
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:11,763
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
I DON'T KNOW.

495
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:16,684
WHAT DID SHE DO, ANGELA? YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE DID. WHAT DID SHE DO, ANGELA?

496
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,146
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID. WHAT ARE
YOU AFRAID OF? WHAT DID SHE DO?

497
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:22,649
WHAT DID SHE DO?
I DON'T KNOW!

498
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,543
WHEN WE WERE GIRLS...

499
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:48,341
WE WOULD LEAVE EACH OTHER MESSAGES.

500
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,887
IN LIGHT.

501
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,308
IN BREATH.

502
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,189
ON THE WINDOWS.

503
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:10,780
JOHN, THERE IS NO 17TH ACT
IN CORINTHIANS.

504
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:16,703
CORINTHIANS GOES TO 21 ACTS
IN THE BIBLE IN HELL.

505
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,039
THEY HAVE BIBLES IN HELL.

506
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:23,084
<i>PAINTS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF REVELATIONS.</i>

507
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,378
<i>SAYS THE WORLD WILL NOT END
BY GOD'S HAND...</i>

508
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,548
<i>BUT BE REBORN IN THE EMBRACE
OF THE DAMNED.</i>

509
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,216
<i>THOUGH IF YOU ASK</i> ME...

510
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,802
FIRE'S FIRE.

511
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:37,223
<i>16:29, 16:30.</i>

512
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:41,436
OH, MY, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT GOOD.

513
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:45,481
"THE SINS OF THE FATHER WOULD ONLY
BE EXCEEDED BY THE SINS OF THE SON."

514
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:49,610
WHOSE SON?
BUT HE CAN'T CROSS OVER, B.

515
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,405
IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS OVER.
WHOSE SON? GOD'S SON?

516
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:56,034
NO, THE OTHER ONE. DEVIL HAD A SON TOO.

517
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,910
HERE IT IS.

518
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,121
THIS IS THE SIGN OF MAMMON...

519
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:03,249
THE SON OF THE DEVIL.
WELL, HOLD ON, IT SAYS HERE...

520
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,420
BEEMAN?
YEAH.

521
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,590
SORRY, I'M...
I'M SORRY, NO, I'M RIGHT HERE.

522
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:17,346
IT SAYS MAMMON HAS NO PATIENCE
FOR HIS FATHER'S RULE...

523
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:22,435
AND YEARNS TO FORGE HIS OWN KINGDOM
OF FIRE AND BLOOD.

524
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:30,777
YEAH. MAMMON WOULD BE
THE LAST DEMON...

525
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,821
WE'D EVER WANT CROSSING OVER
TO OUR PLANE.

526
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:37,617
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I'M READING.
SEEMS TO BE A LOOPHOLE.

527
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:40,119
ALWAYS A CATCH.

528
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:46,834
IT SAYS FIRST MAMMON WOULD HAVE TO
POSSESS A VERY, VERY POWERFUL PSYCHIC.

529
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,629
ISABEL.
<i>BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH.</i>

530
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:54,842
TO CROSS OVER, MAMMON WOULD NEED
DIVINE ASSISTANCE.

531
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,431
TO CROSS OVER, MAMMON WOULD NEED
THE HELP OF GOD.

532
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,393
THE HELP <i>OF GOD?
IT SAYS...</i>

533
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,654
BEEMAN?
JOHN, LOOK...

534
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:19,325
I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER HAD MUCH FAITH,
YOU'VE NEVER HAD MUCH REASON TO...

535
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:23,246
<i>BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE DON'T HAVE FAITH...</i>

536
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:25,873
IN YOU.

537
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,671
BEEMAN? BEEMAN?

538
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,715
DRIVE. FAST.

539
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:52,817
BEEMAN!

540
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,944
SULFUR.

541
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:58,030
BEEMAN!

542
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:03,911
BEEMAN!

543
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,192
WASN'T JUST ISABEL.

544
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:19,028
I USED TO SEE THINGS TOO.

545
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:22,782
BUT...

546
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:26,827
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?
GO HOME, ANGELA.

547
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,454
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

548
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:31,123
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S OUT THERE, TRUST ME.

549
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,376
I'M STRONGER THAN ISABEL.

550
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:37,505
YOUR SISTER EMBRACED HER GIFT,
YOU DENIED YOURS. DENIAL IS A BETTER IDEA.

551
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:42,468
IT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.
STICK WITH ME, THAT WILL CHANGE.

552
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,595
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER GHOST
FOLLOWING ME.

553
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,306
JOHN, THEY KILLED MY SISTER.

554
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,980
I'D TRADE PLACES WITH HER IF I COULD.

555
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,819
I USED TO PRETEND THAT I DIDN'T.

556
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,905
THAT I DIDN'T SEE THINGS.

557
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:04,865
AND...

558
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:10,329
BY THE TIME WE WERE 10,
THEY STARTED FORCING HER TO TAKE...

559
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:13,165
ANTIPSYCHOTICS...

560
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,544
AND HAVE TREATMENTS.
THEY WOULD COME FOR HER...

561
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:20,464
AND SHE'D LOOK AT ME,
AND SHE'D SAY TO ME, "TELL THEM.

562
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:24,468
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM, ANGIE,
THAT YOU CAN SEE THEM TOO?"

563
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:26,971
BUT I LIED.

564
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,849
I SAID:

565
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,686
"I DON'T SEE ANYTHING."

566
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,856
UNTIL ONE DAY...

567
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,442
I FINALLY STOPPED SEEING.

568
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:44,363
I ABANDONED HER, JOHN.

569
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,658
I LEFT HER ALL ALONE.

570
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:57,209
I NEED TO SEE WHAT SHE SAW.

571
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:00,755
PLEASE.

572
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:08,846
YOU DO THIS, THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

573
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,725
YOU SEE THEM...

574
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,561
THEY SEE YOU.

575
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:18,439
UNDERSTAND?

576
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:20,900
YEAH.

577
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:28,908
SURE.

578
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:11,951
SO DO I HAVE TO TAKE THE REST OF
MY CLOTHES OFF, OR CAN I LEAVE THEM ON?

579
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:20,042
JOHN?

580
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:22,294
I'M THINKING.

581
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,925
JOHN?

582
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,594
ON IS FINE.

583
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:46,777
SO WHY WATER?
IT'S A UNIVERSAL CONDUIT.

584
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,990
LUBRICATES THE TRANSITION
FROM ONE PLANE TO ANOTHER.

585
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:55,453
NOW ASK ME IF THERE'S WATER IN HELL.
IS THERE WATER IN HELL?

586
01:05:57,246 --> 01:05:58,706
SIT.

587
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:04,336
NORMALLY, ONLY A PORTION OF THE BODY
HAS TO BE SUSPENDED...

588
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,966
BUT YOU WANTED THE CRASH COURSE.

589
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:11,844
YEAH, I WANTED THE CRASH COURSE.

590
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,096
80, UM...

591
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,557
SO, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

592
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:18,392
LIE DOWN.

593
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,521
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIE DOWN?
YOU HAVE TO BE FULLY SUBMERGED.

594
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:26,025
FOR HOW LONG?

595
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:28,486
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

596
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,706
TAKE A DEEP ONE.

597
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,269
OH, GOD.

598
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:29,064
OH, GOD, ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

599
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,109
OH, ISABEL.

600
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:33,902
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

601
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:38,616
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHERE THEY ARE.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHERE TO FIND THEM...

602
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,910
WHERE TO AIM AND WHERE TO DUCK...

603
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,996
AND I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
WHERE THEY WERE.

604
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:46,206
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IT WASN'T LUCK.

605
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:49,001
ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IT WASN'T LUCK.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN...

606
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:52,338
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT I COULD SEE.

607
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:57,843
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT I COULD SEE.

608
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:04,475
ANGELA.

609
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:10,689
SOMEONE WAS HERE.

610
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:38,592
IT WAS HIS.

611
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:41,762
ROLLING.

612
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,766
NOT A BALL.

613
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:49,395
SOMETHING SMALLER.

614
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,816
SHINY.

615
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:28,892
BALTHAZAR.

616
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:02,760
SORRY.

617
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:12,144
CAN YOU JUST KILL HIM?

618
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,438
WHAT ABOUT THE BALANCE?

619
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:18,275
HALF-BREED TIPPED THE SCALES
WHEN HE STARTED KILLING MY FRIENDS.

620
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,903
I'M JUST ADDING SOME COUNTERWEIGHT.

621
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:56,855
JOHN, I REALLY WANT...

622
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:06,031
THINK OF IT AS A BULLETPROOF VEST.

623
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:15,749
UH-UH. I'M COMING WITH YOU.

624
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:19,545
YOU'RE STAYING IN THE CAR.

625
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:46,822
FIRE? I WAS BORN OF THIS.

626
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:51,535
HOW'S MAMMON CROSSING OVER,
YOU HALF-BREED PIECE OF SHIT?

627
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:59,001
THAT'S BETTER. AU NATUREL.

628
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,343
"STAY IN THE CAR."

629
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,888
"WAIT HERE."

630
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:12,931
MEN.

631
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:28,071
DON'T FIGHT IT, JOHNNY BOY.

632
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,658
ENJOY IT.

633
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,904
WE'LL SEE YOU VERY SOON.

634
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:11,156
NOT REALLY, NO.

635
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:16,495
YOU CAN'T CHEAT IT THIS TIME.
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO HELL.

636
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:18,163
TRUE.

637
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,665
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

638
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,127
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M READING YOU YOUR LAST RITES.

639
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:27,965
SPARE ME YOUR REMEDIAL INCANTATIONS.

640
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,467
YOU DO KNOW WHAT IT IS
TO TRULY BE FORGIVEN?

641
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:33,178
TO BE WELCOMED
INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD.

642
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:35,764
DEMON IN HEAVEN.

643
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:39,393
I'D LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THAT WALL.

644
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:43,814
YOU'RE NOT A PRIEST. YOU HAVE NO POWER.

645
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,192
JUST TELL ME HOW MAMMON
IS CROSSING OVER...

646
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,445
AND YOU CAN GO BACK
TO YOUR SHITHOLE.

647
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,660
OKAY, BALLY, ENJOY IT.

648
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:11,758
"MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOU
AND GRANT YOU THE PARDON OF ALL YOUR SINS.

649
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:16,763
WHOSE SOEVER SINS YOU REMIT ON EARTH,
THEY ARE REMITTED UNTO THEM IN HEAVEN."

650
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:21,518
HOW? HOW'S HE DOING IT?
NO.

651
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,020
NO, I CAN'T.

652
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:28,233
GRANT YOUR CHILD ENTRY
INTO THY KINGDOM...

653
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,864
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.

654
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:35,657
AMEN!

655
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:42,205
THE BLOOD OF GOD.

656
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:43,707
HE FOUND IT.

657
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:48,128
WHATEVER KILLED THE SON OF GOD...

658
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:53,842
WILL GIVE BIRTH TO THE SON OF THE DEVIL.

659
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,804
BY THE WAY...

660
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:03,727
YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR ABSOLUTION
TO BE FORGIVEN...

661
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:05,896
ASSHOLE.

662
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:13,278
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

663
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:19,493
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?
SHE WAS MY ONLY MISSION...

664
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:23,872
AND YOU BROUGHT HER RIGHT TO US.

665
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,170
SO DOES THIS WALKING FAST
MEAN YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING?

666
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:34,633
JESUS DIDN'T DIE FROM BEING NAILED TO A
CROSS. HE WAS KILLED BY A SOLDIER'S SPEAR.

667
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,968
THE SPEAR OF DESTINY.

668
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:40,097
I'M A CATHOLIC, JOHN.
I KNOW THE CRUCIFIXION STORY.

669
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:53,819
I DREW OUT THE SISTER AS YOU ASKED.

670
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:59,616
SHE'S BEEN MADE FLUSH AND READY.

671
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:03,537
SO MUCH POWER.

672
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:09,042
NOW, IF YOU GRANT ME MY RESURRECTION,
I SHALL SERVE.

673
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:15,173
WAIT. BUT I DID AS WE AGREED.

674
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:18,969
NO. PLEASE. NO!

675
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:26,810
BEEMAN SAID MAMMON NEEDED
DIVINE ASSISTANCE TO CROSS OVER.

676
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:31,356
HOW'S THE BLOOD OF GOD'S ONLY SON?

677
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:34,025
THE STAINS ON THE SPEAR.

678
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:38,196
YEAH.
SO HE GETS THE SPEAR.

679
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,532
HE STILL HAS TO LOCATE
A POWERFUL PSYCHIC.

680
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,201
NOT REALLY.

681
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:47,622
TWINS.

682
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,209
WHERE'S THE AMULET?

683
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,547
I DON'T KNOW,
I MUST HAVE LEFT IT IN THE...

684
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,550
WHAT'S WRONG?

685
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,802
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST FEEL...

686
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,377
BIRD ON A LADDER.
SORRY.

687
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:42,135
WAIT HERE.
YEAH.

688
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:48,266
WHO'S A RAT IN A DRESS NOW, HUH, BITCH?

689
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,741
HAVE YOU LOST WHAT
LITTLE MIND YOU HAVE?

690
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,576
DON'T.

691
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:10,205
I NEED TO USE THE CHAIR.

692
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:14,417
I OFFER NO AID TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.

693
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,171
THE BALANCE.
SCREW THE BALANCE.

694
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,763
YOU DARE? IN MY HOUSE?

695
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:32,936
IS THIS NEUTRAL? BULLSHIT.

696
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:36,064
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE STILL PLAYING
BY THE RULES, MIDNITE.

697
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:39,985
AND WHILE YOU'VE BEEN IMITATING
SWITZERLAND, PEOPLE ARE DYING.

698
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:44,572
HENNESSY, BEEMAN, THEY WERE
YOUR FRIENDS ONCE TOO, REMEMBER?

699
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:48,368
I NEED YOUR HELP!

700
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:53,039
CONSIDER IT A LAST REQUEST.

701
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,671
YOU PLAY A DANGEROUS GAME.

702
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:08,847
TWO-HUNDRED-DOLLAR SHIRT, BY THE WAY.

703
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,767
THAT LITTLE SHIT HAS BEEN TRYING...

704
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:15,520
TO CLIMB OUT OF HIS FATHER'S SHADOW
FOR EONS.

705
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:20,608
I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT HE WOULD DO
TO THIS WORLD IF HE EVER BROKE THROUGH.

706
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:26,072
FORGOT HOW BIG IT WAS.

707
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:30,869
TWO HUNDRED SOULS PASSED
THROUGH THIS WOOD AND STEEL AT SING SING.

708
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:32,704
YEAH.

709
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:38,084
WHICH WAY'S EAST?

710
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:58,563
HOW MANY YEARS SINCE YOU'VE SURFED?

711
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,775
LIKE RIDING A BIKE.

712
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,943
NO, NOT REALLY.

713
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:09,449
TELL ME THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE GIRL.

714
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:14,996
DEFINITELY MOSTLY NOT ABOUT THE GIRL.

715
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:22,796
COLD.

716
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:25,090
LITTLE FLAVOR?

717
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:50,490
SURE ABOUT THIS?
NO.

718
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:42,333
MIDNITE!

719
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:51,176
ANY LUCK?
THAT'S A WORD FOR IT.

720
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:54,929
HOLY SHIT. YOU'RE PAPA MIDNITE,
AREN'T YOU?

721
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:07,066
AND HOW EXACTLY DO YOU INTEND
ON GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH TO USE THESE?

722
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:12,322
WELL, THEY DID NOT LEAVE HER UNGUARDED.

723
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,157
HALF-BREEDS ARE MOST VULNERABLE...

724
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:18,286
WHEN THEIR OUTER SKIN IS BREACHED
BY HOLY WATER.

725
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:22,081
CERTAIN OBJECTS, MOST NOTABLY
EITHER OF THE TWO CROSSES OF ISTERIA...

726
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:24,751
HAVE BEEN USED BY EVEN
THE UNORDAINED TO BLESS...

727
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:26,794
COMMONLY OCCURRING WATERS...

728
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:28,713
EVEN RAIN.

729
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,632
MAYBE IF...

730
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:38,723
THERE'S NO USE SITTING ON THE BENCH
IF YOU'RE NOT READY TO PLAY, RIGHT?

731
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:42,769
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE
ENCHANTED CROSSES HERE IN A CABINET...

732
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:45,021
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE WITH US?

733
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:49,734
LOOK, JOHN, NO OFFENSE, I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S A GREAT IDEA, YOU KNOW...

734
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,238
YOU GOING ON A SOLO MISSION
TO SAVE THE WORLD. THAT'S MY VOTE.

735
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,074
I DON'T KNOW WHAT POPS THINKS,
BUT THAT'S...

736
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,453
TAKE HIM, JOHN. KILL HIM AFTER.

737
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:09,879
IF YOU GET BACK, SEE ME
ABOUT MEMBERSHIP. MAYBE.

738
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,966
OKAY. I WILL.

739
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,014
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PRAYING.

740
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:23,142
PRAYING. OKAY.

741
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,728
COME ON.

742
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:24,287
HALF-BREEDS, RIGHT?

743
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:31,669
A BIRTH LIKE THIS, THEY'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA BE GUARDING HER, RIGHT? DEFINITELY.

744
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,588
YEAH.

745
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:41,095
WE CAN GET THROUGH THEM. I MEAN,
THAT CROSS HAS GOTTA WORK, RIGHT?

746
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:42,930
RIGHT?

747
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:46,643
IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE IT IS IN THE BOOKS.

748
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:36,776
WHAT IS THAT?

749
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,278
HELLSPEAK.

750
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:43,991
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

751
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,913
I'M OKAY.

752
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:52,500
SURE.

753
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,931
ONE LAST SHOW.

754
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,467
HI.

755
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,385
MY NAME'S JOHN.

756
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:50,141
YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE BALANCE.

757
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:53,352
LEAVE IMMEDIATELY...

758
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:56,314
OR I WILL DEPORT YOU.

759
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:00,109
ALL OF YOU.

760
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:09,410
GO TO HELL.

761
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,501
HOLY WATER?

762
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,414
ANGELA.

763
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:10,364
UH, JOHN?

764
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:13,993
JOHN.

765
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:21,292
SHIT.

766
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,027
PULL!

767
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:30,277
ANGELA.

768
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:55,928
ANGELA, WHAT IS IT?

769
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,937
GET IT OUT.

770
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:19,952
GET IT OUT.

771
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,580
GET IT...

772
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,875
OH, MY GOD.

773
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,717
NOT BAD, KID.

774
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,722
"NOT BAD." YOU HEAR THAT?

775
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:26,310
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS? IT'S BECAUSE
THIS IS KRAMER. CHAS KRAMER, ASS.

776
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,112
CHAS.

777
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,705
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOHN.

778
01:33:47,957 --> 01:33:49,667
IT'S NOT LIKE THE BOOKS.

779
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:52,503
NO...

780
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,256
IT ISN'T.

781
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:18,988
INTO THE LIGHT, I COMMAND THEE.

782
01:34:20,030 --> 01:34:23,492
INTO THE LIGHT, I COMMAND THEE.

783
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:28,747
INTO THE LIGHT, I COMMAND THEE.

784
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:36,922
INTO THE LIGHT, I COMMAND THEE.

785
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:43,012
YOUR EGO IS ASTOUNDING.

786
01:34:43,179 --> 01:34:44,972
GABRIEL.

787
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:46,473
FIGURES.

788
01:34:47,683 --> 01:34:51,103
AND THE WICKED SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH.

789
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:53,689
YOU JUDGING ME NOW, JOHN?

790
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,944
BETRAYAL, MURDER, GENOCIDE,
CALL ME PROVINCIAL.

791
01:34:59,111 --> 01:35:03,073
I AM SIMPLY SEEKING TO INSPIRE MANKIND
TO ALL THAT WAS INTENDED.

792
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:07,161
BY HANDING EARTH OVER
TO THE SON OF THE DEVIL?

793
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,205
HELP ME HERE.

794
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:17,546
YOU'RE HANDED THIS PRECIOUS GIFT, RIGHT?

795
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:22,801
EACH ONE OF YOU GRANTED REDEMPTION
FROM THE CREATOR.

796
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:26,347
MURDERERS, RAPISTS AND MOLESTERS...

797
01:35:26,513 --> 01:35:28,849
ALL OF YOU, YOU JUST HAVE TO REPENT...

798
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:31,852
AND GOD TAKES YOU INTO HIS BOSOM.

799
01:35:34,188 --> 01:35:36,440
IN ALL THE WORLDS IN ALL THE UNIVERSE...

800
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:39,526
NO OTHER CREATURE CAN MAKE
SUCH A BOAST, SAVE MAN.

801
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:43,322
IT'S NOT FAIR.

802
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:51,455
IF SWEET, SWEET GOD LOVES YOU SO...

803
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:54,625
THEN I'LL MAKE YOU WORTHY OF HIS LOVE.

804
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:59,421
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR A LONG TIME.

805
01:35:59,588 --> 01:36:04,260
IT'S ONLY IN THE FACE OF HORROR
THAT YOU TRULY FIND YOUR NOBLER SELVES.

806
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:08,264
AND YOU CAN BE SO NOBLE.

807
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:12,559
SO...

808
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:15,562
I'LL BRING YOU PAIN.

809
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:18,607
I'LL BRING YOU HORROR.

810
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:23,404
SO THAT YOU MAY RISE ABOVE IT.

811
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:30,786
SO THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO SURVIVE
THIS REIGN OF HELL ON EARTH...

812
01:36:30,953 --> 01:36:33,914
WILL BE WORTHY OF GOD'S LOVE.

813
01:36:34,081 --> 01:36:35,874
GABRIEL...

814
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,585
YOU'RE INSANE.

815
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:43,716
THE ROAD TO SALVATION BEGINS TONIGHT.

816
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:46,218
RIGHT NOW.

817
01:37:27,885 --> 01:37:30,888
I KNOW I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES.

818
01:37:32,431 --> 01:37:35,184
I'M NOT EVEN WELCOME IN YOUR HOUSE.

819
01:37:36,769 --> 01:37:39,605
BUT I COULD USE A LITTLE ATTENTION.

820
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,610
PLEASE.

821
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:33,367
COME FORTH.

822
01:38:53,137 --> 01:38:55,013
HURRY.

823
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,116
MAMMON...

824
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:16,743
SON OF SATAN...

825
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:21,373
I UNLEASH YOU UNTO THIS WORLD.

826
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:16,470
HELLO.

827
01:40:16,637 --> 01:40:18,722
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

828
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:21,183
HELLO, JOHN.

829
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:25,229
JOHN, HELLO.

830
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:33,028
YOU'RE THE ONE SOUL...

831
01:40:33,403 --> 01:40:38,075
I WOULD COME UP HERE
TO COLLECT MYSELF. MM-HM.

832
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:42,746
SO I'VE HEARD.

833
01:40:43,497 --> 01:40:44,831
YOU MIND?

834
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:48,252
OH, GO-GO RIGHT AHEAD. I'VE GOT STOCK.

835
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:50,671
COFFIN NAIL.

836
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,048
VERY FITTING, JOHN.

837
01:40:55,926 --> 01:40:59,471
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU OUT TOO DEEP,
YOU CUT THE TENDONS...

838
01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:02,432
FINGER MOVEMENT GOES
OUT THE WINDOW.

839
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:04,685
LET ME HELP YOU.

840
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:17,656
SEE?

841
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:20,909
SONNY...

842
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:26,206
I'VE GOT A WHOLE THEME PARK
FULL OF RED DELIGHTS FOR YOU.

843
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,500
WELL, AREN'T YOU A PEACH.

844
01:41:30,294 --> 01:41:34,131
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

845
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:40,929
AND YOU DIDN'T...

846
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,432
DID YOU?

847
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:45,350
SO HOW'S THE FAMILY?

848
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:51,481
FAMILY'S DOING JUST FINE.
BUSY, BUSY, BUSY. NEED A VACATION.

849
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:55,319
WORD IS THAT KID OF YOURS
IS A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK.

850
01:41:55,485 --> 01:41:58,530
WELL, ONE DOES WHAT ONE CAN.

851
01:41:58,697 --> 01:42:00,324
HE'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.

852
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,285
BOYS WILL BE BOYS.

853
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,829
WITH GABRIEL.

854
01:42:08,665 --> 01:42:11,460
NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE, REALLY.

855
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:14,254
THEY HAVE THE SPEAR OF DESTINY.

856
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:20,719
"THEY HAVE THE SPEAR OF DESTINY."

857
01:42:29,019 --> 01:42:32,230
OR IS IT ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR CONS?

858
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:36,610
GO LOOK FOR YOURSELF.

859
01:42:39,655 --> 01:42:43,283
YOU'VE WAITED 20 YEARS FOR ME, LU...

860
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:46,703
WHAT'S ANOTHER 20 SECONDS?

861
01:43:51,435 --> 01:43:56,648
LUCIFER.
THIS WORLD IS MINE. IN TIME.

862
01:43:56,815 --> 01:43:59,401
YOU, BEST OF ALL OF US, GABRIEL...

863
01:43:59,568 --> 01:44:04,781
SHOULD UNDERSTAND AMBITION.

864
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,451
SON OF PERDITION.

865
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:09,661
LITTLE HORN.

866
01:44:11,788 --> 01:44:13,999
MOST UNCLEAN.

867
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:16,793
I DO MISS THE OLD NAMES.

868
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:19,880
TIME TO GO HOME, SON.

869
01:44:20,046 --> 01:44:22,507
I WILL SMITE THEE...

870
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:25,594
IN HIS HONOR.

871
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:35,854
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY DOESN'T
HAVE YOUR BACK ANYMORE.

872
01:44:53,663 --> 01:44:55,499
FATHER?

873
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:20,315
SO.

874
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,657
SO.

875
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:32,786
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT? AN EXTENSION?

876
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,543
THE SISTER...

877
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,795
ISABEL.

878
01:45:43,713 --> 01:45:45,632
WHAT ABOUT HER?

879
01:45:47,634 --> 01:45:50,053
LET HER GO HOME.

880
01:45:52,764 --> 01:45:57,352
YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR LIFE
SO SHE CAN GO TO HEAVEN?

881
01:46:07,153 --> 01:46:10,198
FINE. IT'S DONE.

882
01:46:12,826 --> 01:46:16,288
TIME TO GO, JOHN.

883
01:46:16,621 --> 01:46:18,248
YEAH.

884
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,099
THE SACRIFICE.

885
01:47:29,694 --> 01:47:35,700
NO. THIS ONE BELONGS TO ME.

886
01:47:45,669 --> 01:47:51,508
NO. YOU WILL LIVE, JOHN CONSTANTINE.

887
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:56,012
YOU WILL LIVE.

888
01:47:58,598 --> 01:48:01,059
SO YOU WILL HAVE...

889
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:05,397
THE CHANCE TO PROVE...

890
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:13,405
THAT YOUR SOUL TRULY BELONGS IN HELL.

891
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:19,536
OH, YOU WILL LIVE.

892
01:48:23,873 --> 01:48:27,669
YOU WILL LIVE.

893
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:43,536
THANK YOU.

894
01:49:45,955 --> 01:49:47,916
NO PROBLEM.

895
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:05,725
HUMAN

896
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:10,188
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE HUMAN.

897
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:16,402
DO YOU WANT REVENGE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING RIGHT NOW?

898
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:20,448
DO IT.

899
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:23,284
DO IT.

900
01:50:24,828 --> 01:50:26,996
SEEK REVENGE.

901
01:50:27,163 --> 01:50:29,457
END MY LIFE.

902
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,709
GO ON.

903
01:50:33,837 --> 01:50:35,338
BE THE HAND OF GOD.

904
01:50:35,505 --> 01:50:37,882
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

905
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:40,301
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOUR CHOICE.

906
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:47,016
YEAH.

907
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:55,066
THAT'S CALLED PAIN.

908
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:56,609
GET USED TO IT.

909
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:05,201
YOU COULD'VE SHOT ME, JOHN!

910
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:10,206
YOU CHOSE A HIGHER PATH!

911
01:51:11,624 --> 01:51:14,419
LOOK HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING!

912
01:51:39,944 --> 01:51:41,988
NICE SPOT.

913
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:47,744
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

914
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:53,541
SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT A FLOWERS KIND OF GUY.

915
01:51:56,586 --> 01:51:59,130
OH, HOW THOUGHTFUL.

916
01:52:04,427 --> 01:52:06,262
JOHN...

917
01:52:07,722 --> 01:52:10,016
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME THIS?

918
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:11,643
RULES.

919
01:52:11,935 --> 01:52:13,436
HIDE IT.

920
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:16,648
SOMEWHERE NO ONE
WILL EVER BE ABLE TO FIND IT.

921
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,359
NOT EVEN ME.

922
01:52:19,525 --> 01:52:20,860
AH.

923
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:25,323
ALWAYS A CATCH.

924
01:52:26,783 --> 01:52:28,368
YEAH.

925
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:43,299
SO.

926
01:52:44,926 --> 01:52:47,971
I'VE GOT SOME CLEANING UP TO DO.

927
01:52:51,808 --> 01:52:53,810
I'LL...

928
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:56,271
SEE YOU AROUND.

929
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,692
I'D LIKE THAT.

930
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,558
<i>I GUESS THERE'S A PLAN FOR ALL OF US.</i>

931
01:53:33,725 --> 01:53:35,310
<i>I HAD TO DIE...</i>

932
01:53:35,476 --> 01:53:36,811
<i>TWICE...</i>

933
01:53:36,978 --> 01:53:39,188
<i>JUST TO FIGURE THAT OUT.</i>

934
01:53:39,355 --> 01:53:44,360
<i>LIKE THE BOOK SAYS, HE WORKS HIS WORK
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.</i>

935
01:53:44,527 --> 01:53:46,696
<i>SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT...</i>

936
01:53:46,863 --> 01:53:49,407
<i>SOME PEOPLE DON'T.</i>

937
01:59:42,802 --> 01:59:44,929
YOU DID GOOD, KID.
