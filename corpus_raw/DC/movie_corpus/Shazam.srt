1
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:03,784
Thad...

2
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:05,718
I said no toys
at Grandfather's.

3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,223
But it's Christmas.

4
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,091
- Stop it!
- Hey.

5
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,159
Hey, Dad!

6
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,927
Hey! Thad,

7
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,796
you can't go crying to
other people all the time.

8
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:21,335
A man needs to know when
to stand up for himself.

9
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,869
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,

10
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:25,571
will Thad ever be a man?

11
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,177
Ouch.

12
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,248
"Outlook not so good."

13
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,561
You broke it.

14
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,897
Dad? Sid?

15
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:57,339
Someone help me!

16
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,942
Help!

17
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:29,772
Hello?

18
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,526
Thaddeus.

19
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,894
Thaddeus Sivana.

20
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,362
Who are you?

21
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,429
How do you know my name?

22
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:33,365
I am the last of
the Council of Wizards.

23
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:38,573
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

24
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,813
But years have passed,

25
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:46,713
and I grow weak.

26
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:49,149
That is why
I seek a champion

27
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,351
to inherit my magic.

28
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:54,487
You want me to do magic?

29
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,822
With this,

30
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:59,794
all of my powers
will become yours.

31
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,836
Ah. But first...

32
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:10,769
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart

33
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,072
and strong in spirit.

34
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,144
He lies.

35
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:23,281
Don't be his champion.

36
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:27,252
We can give you power.

37
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:30,158
Take the eye.

38
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:34,596
Take it.

39
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:40,000
Your father thinks
you're weak.

40
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:43,004
Show him your power.

41
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,108
Take the eye.

42
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,418
No!

43
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:57,683
What?

44
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,252
What happened?

45
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:04,026
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

46
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,757
But you,

47
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,695
you will never be worthy.

48
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,135
Wait.

49
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,171
- I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

50
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:19,438
Let me back in!

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,973
Calm down, Thad!

52
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:22,308
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

53
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,575
- Calm down.
- Stop!

54
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,217
Hey, I'm gonna kill you,
you little freak!

55
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,718
Stop... Oh!

56
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,932
I was just there.

57
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,135
This man, this wizard,
he took me to a castle and...

58
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,502
Stop. Stop!

59
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,204
Stop it!

60
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:55,808
You miserable, whiny,
little shit!

61
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,743
You could have killed us!

62
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,512
Do you understand that?

63
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,192
Dad?

64
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,197
Dad!

65
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,044
Dad?

66
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,844
You're okay.

67
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,247
You're gonna be okay.

68
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:16,122
You did this.

69
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:17,693
You did this!

70
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,159
No.

71
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:21,161
Dad.

72
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:47,252
Your magic grows weak.

73
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:52,492
Soon, you won't be able to
contain us.

74
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,961
Seeking Spell,

75
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:58,233
find me one soul
who is worthy.

76
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:03,771
No matter
how long it takes.

77
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:50,916
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

78
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,719
Sure glad to see you.

79
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,956
I called as soon as I saw.

80
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,223
They're in there.

81
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,293
You stay here.

82
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,664
Police!

83
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,068
I saw 'em hide
back in there.

84
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,845
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

85
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,475
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

86
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,447
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

87
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,185
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

88
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,122
Stop, stop, stop!

89
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,522
Open this up
right now, kid.

90
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,624
That's a federal offense, kid.
You can't do that!

91
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,594
Do not go in that car.

92
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,829
Come on,
open the door. Please.

93
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:37,432
Please, come on.

94
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,403
Open this, right now!

95
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:45,272
Very good, very funny.

96
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,009
Very funny. That's great.
That's hilarious.

97
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:54,112
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at the
Laurelwood shopping center, please.

98
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:57,983
Dispatch, cancel that request.

99
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:00,085
Some kid stole
our walkie-talkies.

100
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,289
<i>Walkie-talkies?
How old are you?</i>

101
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,662
No, no, no.

102
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:11,833
That's my lunch, kid!

103
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,171
Miss Batson...

104
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,272
I've been looking for you.

105
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:22,510
No. Gosh.

106
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,414
It's me. It's Billy.

107
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,491
Okay.

108
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,295
I want the tiger.

109
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:46,335
I know, honey, I know.
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

110
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:51,038
We got one!

111
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,175
But I wanted a tiger.

112
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:59,344
Oh, but this is
the real prize, baby. See?

113
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:00,946
You can use that
your whole life.

114
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:03,251
You'll always find your way.

115
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,474
I can't let
the ball get away.

116
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,850
Mom?

117
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:42,990
Mom!

118
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:51,133
Mom!

119
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,166
Hey.

120
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:55,537
Who are you with, bud?

121
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:59,540
Yeah, he says
it's Billy Batson.

122
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:02,809
Hey, don't worry, kid.

123
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:05,643
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, okay?

124
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:07,048
They always do.

125
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,926
Mom, I'm home.

126
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:52,393
Yes?

127
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,095
Yeah, uh,
is this Rachel Batson?

128
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:58,864
Who's asking?

129
00:12:58,866 --> 00:12:59,931
Um...

130
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,535
Yeah, see, the thing is...

131
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:04,673
I think you're my mom.

132
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,577
You sure about that?

133
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,283
Sorry to bother you.

134
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:22,287
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

135
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,023
You save me any fries?

136
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:29,228
Foster home in Pittsburgh reported
you missing two weeks ago.

137
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,499
You're sending me back?

138
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,565
No.

139
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:33,965
They don't want you.

140
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,201
- Harsh.
- You laugh,

141
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:40,041
but you've run from foster homes
in six counties, Mr. Batson.

142
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:43,575
From good people

143
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:46,078
who want you,
all in pursuit of someone

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,050
who arguably does not.

145
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,352
It's time someone looked you in the
eye and told it to you straight.

146
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,289
I don't need parents
to play make-believe with.

147
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,157
- I got a mom.
- Yes.

148
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,292
You're some detective.

149
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:03,094
Seventy-three Batsons

150
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:06,932
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out every one.

151
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:09,737
She's still out there.
I know it.

152
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:21,113
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

153
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,985
They run a group home.

154
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:25,950
I can take care of myself.

155
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,619
When you're 18.

156
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:30,422
Until then, I won't have you
living on the streets,

157
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:32,626
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

158
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:36,127
Give these people
a chance.

159
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,796
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

160
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,468
You're out of options.

161
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,478
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

162
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,381
Just know that me and
Rosa, we get it.

163
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,049
We were foster kids
back in the day.

164
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,715
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

165
00:14:57,717 --> 00:15:00,185
Girl, I'm young at heart.

166
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,820
I got my finger
on the pulse.

167
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,355
Yeah, that's a reference

168
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,623
to his blood pressure because he's old.

169
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,224
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

170
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,094
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

171
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:09,764
What?

172
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,965
We know how
overwhelming it can all be.

173
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,834
New house, new faces.

174
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,368
All up in your face.

175
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,241
Just take it
at your own speed.

176
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,286
Hello?

177
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,655
We're home.

178
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:39,127
That's what happens
when you suck!

179
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,627
So much
for the welcome party.

180
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,963
Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

181
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,531
would be Eugene.

182
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:46,866
Is that him?

183
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,634
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

184
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:50,069
Whoa!
Slow down, slow down.

185
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,337
Welcome home!

186
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,238
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

187
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,172
Big hugger.

188
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:55,741
I noticed.

189
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,776
Die, die, die!

190
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,713
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

191
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,382
Hey.

192
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,852
No sodas after dark,
remember?

193
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,587
Whoa. When did it get dark?

194
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,821
Oh, the poster.
I made you one.

195
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:13,092
Come look! Oh, no!

196
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:15,893
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

197
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,464
His goal is to get swole.

198
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,565
Just one hit!
Just one hit!

199
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,666
Oh...

200
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,834
Here.

201
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:26,738
Yes, exactly why your math department
is so uniquely suited for me.

202
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,239
Shut up! No!

203
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,443
I can't even
with Eugene right now.

204
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:33,212
I'm sorry. Mary, hi.
College interview.

205
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,347
I'm Billy.

206
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,881
What am I
most excited about?

207
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:39,352
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

208
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:41,219
What am I most
excited about?

209
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,956
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

210
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,294
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

211
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:52,131
As a foster child, I'm a big believer
in finding family and friends

212
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,536
in the most unlikely
of places.

213
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,204
I'm gonna miss that girl
so much.

214
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,574
It's Caltech.
It's a very prestigious school.

215
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,276
And also all the way
in California.

216
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,611
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

217
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,145
It's a tough subject
for me.

218
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,448
Do you like vegan food?

219
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,882
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

220
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:14,420
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

221
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,255
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

222
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:17,390
- Is that...
- It's okay.

223
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,357
Come, I'll show you
your room.

224
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,629
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

225
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,364
Time to dance
on your grave!

226
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,100
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

227
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,490
Say hi to Billy.

228
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:34,708
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

229
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:39,748
Freddy.

230
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,548
This is Billy Batson.

231
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,216
Make sure you make him
feel at home.

232
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:45,417
- Okay?
- Yeah.

233
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,385
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

234
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:49,220
Oh, one weird thing is,

235
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,902
did you know that Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

236
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:54,395
And apparently, it works.

237
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,463
Yep. Um...

238
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,738
Oh, it's a long way down.

239
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,311
Trust me, I speak
from experience.

240
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:16,180
Victor pushed me.

241
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:19,084
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

242
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,423
It gets real <i>Game of Thrones</i>
around here.

243
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,323
What?

244
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:28,460
Dude, I'm just
messin' around.

245
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:32,267
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

246
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,968
Kidding, again!
You look at me, and you're like,

247
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,804
"Why so dark? You're a disabled foster kid.
You've got it all."

248
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:39,841
Right?

249
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,576
Oh, yeah,
that's the old Batarang.

250
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,412
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

251
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:49,254
I could kill you in your
sleep with that thing.

252
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,485
You more of a Supes guy?

253
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:56,154
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

254
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,057
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

255
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,759
It's legit.

256
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,328
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

257
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,498
What's in the bag?

258
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,731
Hey.

259
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,066
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

260
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:12,938
You don't gotta talk
so much, you know.

261
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,744
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

262
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,702
Dinner!

263
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,745
All hands on deck.

264
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,581
Thank you for this family.

265
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,182
Thank you for this day.

266
00:19:57,184 --> 00:20:01,019
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

267
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:07,058
Big school.
2,000 students, you might think,

268
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,693
"Wow, so many strangers."

269
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,263
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

270
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,466
Then it's,
"Wow, so many friends."

271
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:16,701
The principal, her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

272
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:18,636
Next.

273
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:20,372
This is
our security scanner.

274
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,941
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

275
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,843
I know what it is.

276
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:26,879
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

277
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,382
Silence makes me
uncomfortable.

278
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,952
She's almost never
uncomfortable.

279
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,754
Have a good first day,
big brother.

280
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,890
Look, you don't have to
hug me all the time.

281
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:40,461
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

282
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,397
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,933
- Hey.
- Hey.

284
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,704
I didn't mean
to make her...

285
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,544
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

286
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:01,212
<i>He said
I must be pure of heart.</i>

287
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:03,481
<i>He call himself a wizard.</i>

288
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:09,220
<i>He even dressed like a wizard
from</i> Harry Potter <i>or some...</i>

289
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:12,423
<i>But you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

290
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:17,063
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember what he said to you?

291
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,732
<i>He tested me.</i>

292
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,235
<i>There were these statues.</i>

293
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:26,337
<i>Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.</i>

294
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,972
<i>Horrible things.</i>

295
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:30,411
And do these approximate
what you saw?

296
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:35,713
<i>Yes, that's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

297
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:37,583
<i>I don't understand.
How do you know...</i>

298
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:42,020
Recurrent imagery has proven very
common in cases of mass hysteria.

299
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:43,055
<i>Mass hysteria?</i>

300
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:45,792
I know. The term's
a bit theatrical.

301
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:48,660
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

302
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:51,130
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

303
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:54,266
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

304
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,769
The symbols.

305
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:02,408
Ask her about the symbols.

306
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,777
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.
But as an example of recurrent imagery,

307
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,747
maybe you'll recall seeing

308
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:12,217
these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

309
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:15,086
<i>I don't remember
any symbols, no.</i>

310
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:18,923
<i>I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

311
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:21,192
<i>I remember the numbers
on my alarm clock.</i>

312
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:22,460
<i>They kept shifting.</i>

313
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:23,664
Video?

314
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,732
Show me the video.

315
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,335
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

316
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:33,471
<i>Um, one moment, I can send it.</i>

317
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:37,275
<i>Hello? Oh, my God!</i>

318
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,143
<i>Who's there?</i>

319
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:42,517
<i>Hello? What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

320
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:47,352
<i>I'm going to call
the police!</i>

321
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:50,055
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me</i>

322
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:52,324
<i>and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.</i>

323
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,093
<i>It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.</i>

324
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,197
<i>He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.</i>

325
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,365
<i>...and how you were brought
there to save the world.</i>

326
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,601
<i>- Wearing a cape.
- And there's no ceiling.</i>

327
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:04,036
We ran
the numbers again...

328
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:05,638
Dr. Sivana!

329
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,842
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

330
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:13,911
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

331
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:16,282
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

332
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:17,752
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

333
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,269
Doctor, what is all this?

334
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,272
All these years...

335
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:44,343
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

336
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:48,346
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

337
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,018
to open the door.

338
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:54,186
But on that woman's
alarm clock,

339
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:55,690
the seven symbols.

340
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,663
The sequence
repeated itself seven times.

341
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,097
That's the difference.

342
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,401
Is this
some sort of joke?

343
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,169
It may seem that way to you

344
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:14,573
because we're not in actuality
studying mass hysteria.

345
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:17,242
What all these people
have seen,

346
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:20,880
every single one of them,
is absolutely real.

347
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:23,981
An alarm clock
malfunctions

348
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:27,119
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

349
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,220
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

350
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:31,960
You can't believe
any of this is real.

351
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:45,839
Why, yes.

352
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:53,748
Yes, I do.

353
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:36,857
I've been waiting for
this moment for so long...

354
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,257
and now here we are.

355
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:42,296
You don't remember me,
do you?

356
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:50,971
I remember you.

357
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,904
You were a boy.

358
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,007
And now you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

359
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,411
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

360
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:02,413
No, you don't.

361
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:06,684
What you said to me all those years
ago made me realize who I really was.

362
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:08,321
And you know something?

363
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:13,792
I am not pure of heart.

364
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:18,399
The wizard
is too weak to stop us.

365
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:22,133
No!

366
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:23,270
No!

367
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:35,083
You never found
your champion.

368
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:39,420
But we found ours.

369
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:58,472
You are
the true champion.

370
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:31,370
They're using you.

371
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:34,573
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

372
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:44,749
Through you, they'll spread their
poison to everything they touch!

373
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:48,019
Make mankind
turn on each other!

374
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:50,588
You seek
a pure soul, old man,

375
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,926
but no one's worthy.

376
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:04,505
Flight or invisibility?

377
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:07,104
If you could have
one superpower,

378
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:09,140
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

379
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:11,677
I mean, everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

380
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,845
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

381
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,514
No, no.
'Cause heroes fly.

382
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:17,481
And who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

383
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,884
But invisibility, no way.

384
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,554
That's pervy.

385
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:23,622
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

386
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:26,064
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

387
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,767
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

388
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,000
They asked people
the same question.

389
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:37,670
You know, what power
do you want?

390
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:39,036
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

391
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:40,505
And most people,
since they knew

392
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,207
that it was secret,
said invisibility.

393
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:43,642
And I think that's 'cause
most people

394
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:46,177
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

395
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,279
You're gonna run away.

396
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,849
I mean, you stole
my Superman bullet.

397
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,683
Dude, I get it.
I get it.

398
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:54,553
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

399
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,455
You don't trust anyone.

400
00:28:56,457 --> 00:29:01,159
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

401
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:03,931
I didn't steal
your dumb bullet.

402
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,204
Hey. How was it today?

403
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,607
That good, huh?

404
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,044
Whoa!

405
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,812
Oh, my God! Freddy.

406
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:21,947
Are you okay?

407
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,351
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

408
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:26,484
What the hell?

409
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:28,120
- What is wrong with you two?
- Oh, ho!

410
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,889
No way that's gonna buff out.

411
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,222
You gonna pay
for that, Freeman?

412
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,891
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

413
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,025
Yeah, sure. Um...

414
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:35,494
You guys take these?

415
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,199
Brett, stop!

416
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,768
Don't touch my brother!

417
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,671
What, do you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

418
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,238
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

419
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,940
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

420
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:50,374
Stand up for yourself.

421
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:51,709
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

422
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:54,279
Oh, yeah.
You don't have a mommy.

423
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,417
Hey.

424
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,388
Man, sorry about that.

425
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,956
That wasn't fair,
but then again you don't fight fair, so...

426
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,198
Back off, assbags.
I know how to use these things.

427
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:20,905
Hey! He's getting away!
Where you going?

428
00:30:20,907 --> 00:30:22,509
Freddy, are you okay?

429
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:25,610
Hey, let's go
through the back.

430
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:26,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:35,853
Nowhere to run!

432
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,221
Hey!

433
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:38,989
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

434
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,526
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

435
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:42,529
Whoa!

436
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,831
No, no, no.

437
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,198
You're dead, kid.

438
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,665
Yeah, you think
you're funny.

439
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,537
We know where you go to
school, buddy!

440
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:55,739
<i>Next stop,
30th Street Station.</i>

441
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:58,078
<i>Change for the regional
rail lines.</i>

442
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,164
Uh... Hello?

443
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,701
What's going on?

444
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:36,150
Help!

445
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:51,766
Okay.

446
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:09,115
Holy moly.

447
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,599
Hello?

448
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:43,081
What the hell?

449
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,752
Who's doing this?

450
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:19,049
Hi. Um...

451
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:21,719
I was supposed to get off
at 30th.

452
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:23,321
Billy Batson.

453
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:24,956
How'd you know my name?

454
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:29,294
I am the last of
the Council of Wizards.

455
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:31,765
Keeper of
the Rock of Eternity.

456
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,532
Oh...

457
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:34,902
You're...

458
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,369
that guy.

459
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,237
Hey, listen, I don't have
any money.

460
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,442
Do not patronize me, boy.

461
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:47,078
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

462
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,449
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

463
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:56,121
But long ago,
we chose a champion

464
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:58,159
and we chose recklessly.

465
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:04,461
He used his power for revenge,

466
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:08,668
releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into your world.

467
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,805
Millions of lives were lost.

468
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:19,512
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

469
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:27,217
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

470
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,591
until I find
one truly good person.

471
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,693
Strong in spirit,

472
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:37,195
pure in heart.

473
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:40,434
Look, man,
maybe this is magic

474
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,066
and, I don't know,

475
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:46,403
but the people you're looking
for, good, pure people,

476
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,606
I'm not one of them.

477
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,744
I don't know
if anyone is, really.

478
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:54,347
You, Billy Batson,

479
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:56,514
are all I have.

480
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:59,383
All the world has.

481
00:35:00,954 --> 00:35:03,220
Lay your hands on my staff.

482
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:04,822
Gross.

483
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:07,858
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

484
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,561
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

485
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:15,934
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

486
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:17,501
Thanks.

487
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,938
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

488
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,874
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

489
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:27,177
Their thrones lie empty.

490
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,780
My magic
must be passed on.

491
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:33,050
Now, speak my name!

492
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:36,420
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

493
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,691
My name is...

494
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,960
Shazam.

495
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:44,262
Wait, for real?

496
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:45,966
- Say it!
- Okay!

497
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:47,768
Jeez.

498
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,880
So just say it? Like...

499
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:02,983
Shazam?

500
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,615
Yes!

501
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:08,519
Carry my name, and with it,
you carry all my powers.

502
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:11,423
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

503
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:14,724
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

504
00:36:14,726 --> 00:36:18,632
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

505
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:30,842
What happened to me?
Why am...

506
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:32,909
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

507
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:36,849
You have been transformed to your
full potential, Billy Batson.

508
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:42,119
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

509
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:44,724
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await.

510
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:58,938
Get me outta here!

511
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,874
Dope!

512
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:07,077
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

513
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,947
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape.

514
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:13,483
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

515
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
Ow!

516
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:23,964
Hey!

517
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:27,900
Hey, babe!

518
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:35,507
<i>Yes, Officer.</i>

519
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,077
I'm aware he's run away
in the past.

520
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:40,110
Twenty-three times?

521
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:43,748
Guy's got no social media presence.
At all.

522
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,052
The guy is a ghost.

523
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:10,541
You know, guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

524
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:11,876
More than happy.

525
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:13,344
But no, you gotta wash
the dishes.

526
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:14,845
That's what's
more important.

527
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,246
"What are you gonna do,
Freddy, run after him?"

528
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:18,950
Very funny.

529
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,952
No, I said, don't scream.

530
00:38:20,954 --> 00:38:22,619
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

531
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,188
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

532
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,990
It's Billy!

533
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:28,059
You asked me flight or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

534
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:30,795
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

535
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:32,796
Meet me back here
after lights-out?

536
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,166
'Sup, bud?
You all right?

537
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:39,503
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

538
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm really sad
because Billy's gone.

539
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:46,610
And, you know, maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

540
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:48,244
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

541
00:38:48,246 --> 00:38:51,648
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

542
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,650
We'll find him, 'kay?

543
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,619
You don't snore that bad.

544
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:57,623
But you kinda smell.

545
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:10,233
Oh, thank God!

546
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:12,202
Hey. Stop right there.

547
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:14,706
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

548
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,842
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

549
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:18,043
What?

550
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:19,644
All I have to do
is press "dial" on this thing.

551
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,246
No! No, I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

552
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:24,648
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

553
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,883
- Oh, no! No, no, no.
- No!

554
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,253
Stupid adult hands.

555
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,954
But you saw it.

556
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:34,023
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

557
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,959
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

558
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,461
but you're the only person
that I know

559
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:38,996
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

560
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:41,067
- That's Batman.
- What?

561
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:43,804
Forget it.

562
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,806
Can I...

563
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:48,875
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

564
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:59,286
Oh... Oh, my God!

565
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,485
It's crazy, right?

566
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,287
What are your superpowers?

567
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:07,124
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing.

568
00:40:07,126 --> 00:40:08,728
Okay. Can you fly?

569
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:11,729
<i>Okay!</i>

570
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:13,565
Let's do this.

571
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,367
How do we do this?

572
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,836
Just, um, like, Superman it.

573
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,139
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

574
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,476
Come on.

575
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,177
How is any of this obvious?

576
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,711
Okay.

577
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:30,648
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

578
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,016
I read this deep dive

579
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:33,684
into peer-reviewed studies
about superpowers

580
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:36,487
and in six out of ten,
belief is the key.

581
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:39,124
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay.
Okay. I believe I can fly.

582
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,025
I believe I...

583
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:43,028
I believe I can fly.

584
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,164
I believe...

585
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:51,204
Whoa!

586
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:54,074
Did you believe?

587
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,476
Yeah.

588
00:40:58,478 --> 00:40:59,980
You wanna try invisibility?

589
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:02,612
How do I do...

590
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:04,115
Forget it. You know, okay.

591
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:06,086
Okay, okay, okay.

592
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:11,621
Oh, my God! It worked!

593
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:12,826
Where'd you go?

594
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,327
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

595
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:16,626
Where?

596
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,829
I'm invisible!

597
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:20,597
I'm right here. Over here.

598
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,534
I'm invisible!
I'm invisible!

599
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:25,568
Hey!

600
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,204
Nice outfit, dipshit.

601
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:31,208
I might've been
testing invisibility

602
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,244
and super-intelligence
at the same time.

603
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:36,246
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

604
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:45,555
Oh, my God!
The lightning emblem!

605
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:48,260
It was staring us right in
the face the whole time.

606
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:50,894
Literally!

607
00:41:58,672 --> 00:41:59,704
Okay, okay.

608
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,238
Clearly, we gotta give you

609
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,840
- a lightning-themed superhero name.
- Yeah.

610
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,153
Oh, right.

611
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:16,155
Hey, yo! Back...

612
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:19,289
off.

613
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:23,028
Hyper-speed, check.

614
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,095
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

615
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:26,697
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

616
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,577
I doused him with pepper spray.

617
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:30,367
Smart move.

618
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:33,470
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

619
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:35,373
I'm your age.

620
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,742
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

621
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:40,311
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

622
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:42,412
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

623
00:42:42,414 --> 00:42:46,516
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

624
00:42:46,518 --> 00:42:47,784
So get woke, bro.

625
00:42:47,786 --> 00:42:49,353
I'm sorry, who are you?

626
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,921
His name is Thundercrack,

627
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:55,927
hero to the people with all the power
and speed of lightning all in one.

628
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,329
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

629
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:00,697
Mister Philadelphia.

630
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:02,166
That's a cream cheese thing,
dude!

631
00:43:02,168 --> 00:43:03,834
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got all the powers.

632
00:43:03,836 --> 00:43:06,403
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

633
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:08,474
Power Boy, do you know
this child?

634
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,577
Like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

635
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,579
Yeah. He's like
a little miniature manager.

636
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:17,548
I'm his manager.

637
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,083
But Power Boy's not gonna work, either,
okay? So work on something else.

638
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:21,753
Hey, bud, what could...

639
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:29,827
Electricity manipulation,
hyper-speed, super-strength.

640
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:31,229
Dude, you're stacked!

641
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,030
You're almost as cool
as Superman. Almost.

642
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:35,099
I didn't see you.
I don't know what just happened here.

643
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,934
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

644
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:38,202
I'm not doing it
for the money.

645
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:39,670
Thank you for
your kind donation.

646
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:41,405
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

647
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:43,340
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

648
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:46,309
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

649
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,345
Seventy-three bucks?

650
00:43:48,347 --> 00:43:49,950
Come on!

651
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,650
Hey, wait a minute.

652
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:54,219
I just got an idea.

653
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:57,954
I'd like to purchase some of
your finest beer, please.

654
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:19,275
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

655
00:44:19,277 --> 00:44:21,244
Freddy, Freddy,
would you relax?

656
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:24,115
Look at me. I am the fake ID.

657
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:25,349
Everything from the register!

658
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:27,117
Go, go! Now!

659
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,686
Come on! We don't have any time.
Let's go. Move!

660
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:31,021
We want it all! Hurry.

661
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,425
This is your chance.

662
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,693
Oh! Okay.

663
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:38,131
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

664
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,000
That's it. That's it.

665
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:43,400
Gentlemen,

666
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,805
why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

667
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,442
Billy, look out!

668
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:04,722
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

669
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:06,490
I'm bulletproof.

670
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:10,094
Today is December 8th,

671
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:12,532
and this is video proof of
authenticity.

672
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:15,298
Shoot him again.

673
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,967
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here. Go. Both of you!

674
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:18,405
Come on. Go to town.

675
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:26,344
Wait, wait, wait.

676
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:28,646
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

677
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:30,283
or if you are.

678
00:45:31,115 --> 00:45:32,383
Shoot him in the face.

679
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:34,254
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

680
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:43,628
It kinda tickles.

681
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:45,731
You're dead.

682
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:53,070
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

683
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:55,373
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

684
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:58,708
Come on!
Let's get outta here.

685
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,177
Hey.

686
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:02,048
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

687
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:05,085
Bleh!

688
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:06,983
Ugh!

689
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:08,619
That tastes
like actual vomit.

690
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,557
Hey, do you know
habanero jerky,

691
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,659
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole in your stomach?

692
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:16,827
Worth it.

693
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:18,195
Yeah.
Probably not you, though.

694
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:19,764
You've probably got
stomach superpowers.

695
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:21,164
Probably. Oh, hey.

696
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,532
What's up?
I'm a superhero.

697
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:24,101
Yeah, his name is, uh,

698
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:25,603
Captain Sparklefingers.

699
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:27,704
No, it's not. No, it's not!
That's not my name.

700
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:30,273
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

701
00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:32,008
Oh, okay. I'm out.

702
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,380
Hey, wait up!

703
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:42,119
I mean,
it's a pretty sick view.

704
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:45,592
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

705
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:50,329
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

706
00:46:51,163 --> 00:46:53,063
I mean, no offense,

707
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:58,034
but, like, at first you were kinda
like the opposite of how Darla is.

708
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:00,304
A dick?

709
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:02,807
Your words.
Not mine.

710
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:04,344
But yeah.

711
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:07,311
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

712
00:47:07,313 --> 00:47:09,579
is either on drugs or asleep
by now.

713
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:11,016
Wanna head home?

714
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:13,418
Looking like this?

715
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,684
Well, yeah,

716
00:47:14,686 --> 00:47:17,753
I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair to go back to,

717
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:19,623
but that's long-term.

718
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:22,429
Right now, we have
a bunk bed.

719
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:29,032
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

720
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:32,168
This is what he does, Rosa.

721
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,405
Difference is,
when they find him,

722
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:36,840
we'll be the first
to take him back.

723
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:38,311
With open arms.

724
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:43,713
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

725
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:46,749
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

726
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,519
At least I did.

727
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,921
- Yeah.
- Even Mary did it.

728
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:52,358
Hmm? Twice.

729
00:47:54,193 --> 00:47:56,159
That second time
she ran off,

730
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:58,564
you said something to me
I'll never forget.

731
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:00,363
You said,

732
00:48:00,365 --> 00:48:02,766
"It's not a home
until you call it a home.

733
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:04,536
It's something you choose."

734
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:10,708
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

735
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,313
Whether he chooses to call it a
home, that's up to him.

736
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:17,683
Yeah.

737
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:20,918
You gonna help me
with this tree?

738
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,190
This tree's so sad.

739
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:27,492
Hello?

740
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:29,592
Got lost
finding the bathroom.

741
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:31,461
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie.
Good night.

742
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:32,963
- Good night.
- Night.

743
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:36,733
Freddy, who is that?

744
00:48:36,735 --> 00:48:39,235
It's Billy. He's just really
tired and he has laryngitis.

745
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:40,403
What? Laryngitis!

746
00:48:40,405 --> 00:48:42,206
I'm just kidding!
I'm just kidding.

747
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,008
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go to beddy-bye.

748
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,510
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

749
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:48,144
Billy, you're back.
Let us see you.

750
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:50,414
We've been so worried
about you.

751
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,249
I told you
this was a bad idea!

752
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:53,950
Freddy?

753
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,035
Freddy,
what happened to the stairs?

754
00:48:57,155 --> 00:48:58,722
Mmm!

755
00:48:58,724 --> 00:49:00,224
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

756
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:01,786
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

757
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:06,229
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

758
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:07,398
A wizard made me
look like this.

759
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,664
Maybe don't start
with "wizard."

760
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,735
It's just gonna make her
more confused.

761
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:13,297
Some old guy brought me to a temple
and he made me say, "Shazam."

762
00:49:14,873 --> 00:49:16,541
Rosa!

763
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,742
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

764
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:20,346
You can switch
by saying, "Shazam."

765
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:25,682
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

766
00:49:25,684 --> 00:49:27,016
Uh...

767
00:49:27,018 --> 00:49:29,318
I was screwing in a bulb.

768
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,389
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

769
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:34,525
But it's Billy.
He's a hero.

770
00:49:34,527 --> 00:49:36,059
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

771
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:37,626
that endangers us, okay?

772
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:40,563
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

773
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:42,199
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

774
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:43,934
- Moderate.
- No.

775
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:44,969
Oh, God.

776
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:46,670
Okay, listen, D,

777
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:48,972
you cannot tell a single soul about
this, all right? Please?

778
00:49:48,974 --> 00:49:51,677
Why? What if it's people
we trust?

779
00:49:54,512 --> 00:49:56,579
Because good sisters
don't tell secrets.

780
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:59,249
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

781
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:00,851
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

782
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:02,220
Is if you fixed
the doorknob for us, okay?

783
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:03,487
Yeah.

784
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:05,322
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

785
00:50:05,324 --> 00:50:06,844
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

786
00:50:12,331 --> 00:50:14,231
Hello, sir.
How may I help you?

787
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:16,566
Hi. Sir?

788
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:18,836
Sir, you can't go in there.
Excuse me!

789
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:21,237
You cannot go in there!

790
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:26,510
Sorry I'm late.

791
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:28,878
Thad, this is for
board members only.

792
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,382
I'm aware of that, Father.

793
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:38,956
Now, that night in the car.

794
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:43,226
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

795
00:50:43,228 --> 00:50:46,863
So much easier to blame me,
wasn't it?

796
00:50:46,865 --> 00:50:49,566
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

797
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,304
you'd still have your legs.

798
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:54,673
Well, now I have proof.

799
00:50:57,143 --> 00:50:58,842
That's enough, Thad.

800
00:50:58,844 --> 00:51:02,780
Dear Sid, you think?

801
00:51:02,782 --> 00:51:06,950
You know, even before the
accident, you belittled me.

802
00:51:06,952 --> 00:51:10,153
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

803
00:51:10,155 --> 00:51:12,389
You don't need
to make a scene.

804
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:14,025
Oh, brother,

805
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:16,563
the scene
has only just begun.

806
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,831
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

807
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:22,867
What?

808
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,235
Ask the ball
if you're man enough

809
00:51:24,237 --> 00:51:25,637
to throw me
out of this room.

810
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:31,510
Let me spoil it for you.

811
00:51:39,851 --> 00:51:43,322
Outlook not so good.

812
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,795
I've come here during the
season of giving to give you...

813
00:51:53,431 --> 00:51:55,367
what you deserve.

814
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:09,815
Run!

815
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,858
Oh, my God! No!

816
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,327
No! No!

817
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:13,811
Help!

818
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:15,679
Somebody!

819
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:18,081
Help me!

820
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,585
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

821
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,055
What sin best befits you,
Father? Hmm?

822
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:27,726
I'll give you anything.

823
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:29,726
Money.

824
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:31,597
The company.
You want the company?

825
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,498
There it is.

826
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:36,967
Greed.

827
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:39,536
Do you honestly think

828
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:43,643
all this material
you've accumulated

829
00:53:45,043 --> 00:53:47,045
amounts to actual power?

830
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:52,518
This is power.

831
00:53:54,052 --> 00:53:55,755
More than you ever had.

832
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:58,557
More than anyone has.

833
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,226
There is one more powerful.

834
00:54:03,228 --> 00:54:07,398
The wizard
found his champion.

835
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,369
Kill the champion before he
learns his true potential,

836
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:16,539
or he will defeat you.

837
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:18,643
Show me where to find him.

838
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,027
Oh, Greed,

839
00:54:36,594 --> 00:54:38,063
you can have him.

840
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:40,362
No.

841
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,568
No. Oh, no!

842
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:47,903
No! No! No!

843
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,825
<i>Family
is more than just a word.</i>

844
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:14,032
<i>At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.</i>

845
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,126
Uh, Burke.

846
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,096
Where's the truck?

847
00:55:53,105 --> 00:55:54,173
I can hear it.

848
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:06,217
Oh, my God!

849
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:07,717
My truck!

850
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:09,488
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

851
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:12,490
You know, guys,

852
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:14,527
I don't think
that's gonna buff out.

853
00:56:23,168 --> 00:56:24,467
Hey.

854
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:26,670
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

855
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:28,738
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

856
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,041
And I can't?

857
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:32,876
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

858
00:56:32,878 --> 00:56:34,778
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

859
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,380
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:38,583
Okay.

861
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,488
You boys got a hall pass?

862
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,960
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

863
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:50,863
You!

864
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:55,197
You look like you're
up to something.

865
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,566
Me? Up to something?

866
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:58,668
No. Never am I up
to something.

867
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,871
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

868
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,805
The business office.

869
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,644
The business office, huh?

870
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,376
Sure, kid.

871
00:57:07,378 --> 00:57:09,311
Look, parents or guardians

872
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:12,918
must appear physically
to check out students.

873
00:57:13,518 --> 00:57:14,952
Gotcha.

874
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:16,952
Okay, well,
you hear that, Dad?

875
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:18,354
- Hey!
- Shazam!

876
00:57:18,356 --> 00:57:20,255
Well, hey there, son,

877
00:57:20,257 --> 00:57:22,124
and hey there,
other son that I also have

878
00:57:22,126 --> 00:57:24,193
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

879
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:28,900
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

880
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:31,334
doing all the work stuff.

881
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:35,072
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

882
00:57:35,074 --> 00:57:36,438
Oh.

883
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,974
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

884
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:40,043
That's not funny.

885
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:43,179
I'm gonna talk to him
about that. I apologize.

886
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,882
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

887
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:46,715
to check my sons
out of school.

888
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:50,822
So, thank you so much for keeping 'em
safe, Detective Moron.

889
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:55,858
It's Moran.

890
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,762
- You ready?
- Algebra!

891
00:57:58,697 --> 00:58:00,199
Science!

892
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:02,565
English!

893
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:05,769
Health!

894
00:58:17,682 --> 00:58:18,818
Oh. Oh.

895
00:58:38,536 --> 00:58:39,896
Are you okay?

896
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,310
I'm sorry!

897
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,166
More powerful
than a locomotive.

898
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:47,503
Locomotive. What are you?
An old prospector?

899
00:59:47,505 --> 00:59:50,076
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

900
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:55,146
Single bound.

901
00:59:57,682 --> 00:59:59,416
Oh!

902
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:00,615
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

903
01:00:00,617 --> 01:00:01,784
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

904
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:02,985
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

905
01:00:02,987 --> 01:00:04,753
Your phone's charged.

906
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:06,755
Your phone's charged.

907
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:09,291
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

908
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,860
I've been thinking
about that.

909
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:12,662
What about this?

910
01:00:12,664 --> 01:00:14,865
"That's why you don't mess with
electricity."

911
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:16,999
Catchphrases obviously aren't
one of your superpowers.

912
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,601
And your phone's charged.

913
01:00:18,603 --> 01:00:21,371
- Well, you think you can do better?
- What the hell?

914
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:23,442
Let there be light.

915
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:29,013
Yeah, yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby, okay.

916
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:35,584
How do I... Never mind.

917
01:00:35,586 --> 01:00:36,789
Shazam!

918
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,527
Shazam!

919
01:00:50,536 --> 01:00:52,302
What'd you see?
What'd you see? Were there boobies?

920
01:00:52,304 --> 01:00:54,539
You see nipples?
Why aren't you talking?

921
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:57,541
We're gonna need more money.

922
01:00:57,543 --> 01:00:58,907
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

923
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:00,411
Dude, they were
very convincing!

924
01:01:05,717 --> 01:01:06,919
Oh, get it, get it!

925
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:10,287
Go, go, go!

926
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:16,896
No!

927
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:18,894
Stop! No!

928
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:20,130
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

929
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:22,298
- I'm not even looking! Oh!
- Stop!

930
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,400
- Why?
- Oh, and done!

931
01:01:24,402 --> 01:01:25,937
Finished him.

932
01:01:29,641 --> 01:01:31,340
A lair.

933
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:32,407
Yes.

934
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:34,077
And obviously,
we're gonna have to

935
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,722
- be making this purchase anonymously.
- Mmm.

936
01:01:35,746 --> 01:01:37,146
Obviously.

937
01:01:37,148 --> 01:01:39,916
And, um, if you have
a location on a cliff.

938
01:01:39,918 --> 01:01:41,650
Like a castle-esque
type thing.

939
01:01:41,652 --> 01:01:43,286
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

940
01:01:43,288 --> 01:01:45,354
seas, below it.
Rough, you know...

941
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:46,856
Like a waterfall,

942
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:48,891
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

943
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:51,528
Look, Maximum Voltage,
is it?

944
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,463
You can call me Max.

945
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:55,565
Look, Max, why don't you
just start with

946
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,099
how many bedrooms
you're looking for?

947
01:01:57,101 --> 01:01:58,501
- One!
- Seven.

948
01:01:58,503 --> 01:01:59,603
- One?
- Seven?

949
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:01,240
What, am I running
a foster home now?

950
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:15,385
Have you seen the one where
he throws the football into space?

951
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:16,853
So dope.

952
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:18,354
Hey, you guys gotta wonder
who's filming those, right?

953
01:02:18,356 --> 01:02:20,755
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

954
01:02:20,757 --> 01:02:22,159
I mean, is it, though?

955
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:24,494
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

956
01:02:24,496 --> 01:02:25,662
Holding a camera?

957
01:02:25,664 --> 01:02:28,565
Staring in the face
of danger.

958
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:30,068
Like some weirdo fanboy.

959
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,802
Hey, Freeman.

960
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:34,604
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

961
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:37,673
What, is your bestie gonna hit
us with a wheelchair this time?

962
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:39,309
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

963
01:02:39,311 --> 01:02:41,191
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

964
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:43,746
Okay, Freddy.

965
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:46,349
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

966
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:48,818
Frequency Flinger.
Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

967
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,686
Yeah. He's a man
of many names.

968
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:51,887
You know
the Red Cyclone?

969
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:54,557
You? My ass you do.

970
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,492
Oh, we're a lot closer
than you think.

971
01:02:56,494 --> 01:02:58,729
Maybe even at this
very moment.

972
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:00,362
Prove it.

973
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,898
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna come to lunch.

974
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,767
Right, right, Billy?

975
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:07,369
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's gonna
be bringing us dessert, right?

976
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:12,108
Tomorrow at lunch.
You'll see.

977
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,414
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

978
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:21,851
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

979
01:03:21,853 --> 01:03:24,787
Except when it makes you look
cool, then it's all good.

980
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:26,423
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

981
01:03:26,425 --> 01:03:28,490
They're just super douchebags.

982
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:31,026
So, you're breaking
your own rule?

983
01:03:31,028 --> 01:03:32,695
Got it.

984
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:36,532
This thing is as
much as mine as it is yours.

985
01:03:36,534 --> 01:03:39,269
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

986
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:41,570
Billy, you're still
gonna do it, though, right?

987
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:43,975
I mean, what would a good brother do?

988
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:47,045
All hands on deck.

989
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:53,316
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

990
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:57,022
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

991
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:03,860
Big news in Philly.
Got a costumed hero.

992
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:05,095
He's doing good.

993
01:04:05,097 --> 01:04:07,130
Yeah,
but is he, though?

994
01:04:07,132 --> 01:04:10,099
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

995
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:13,469
Share with us
your perspective, Eugene.

996
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:16,438
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

997
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,575
So what?
I can charge a phone with a plug.

998
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:20,577
Preach.

999
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:24,079
Pedro, any thoughts?

1000
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:26,115
Costume's stupid.

1001
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:27,849
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1002
01:04:27,851 --> 01:04:29,485
Big white cape like he's
getting married or something.

1003
01:04:29,487 --> 01:04:31,954
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1004
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:34,157
Ever think about that?

1005
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:35,891
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1006
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:40,162
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see the positive.

1007
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:42,164
Okay, well,
I think it looks like

1008
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,432
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1009
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:46,970
Very specific.
All right.

1010
01:04:46,972 --> 01:04:48,371
Maybe to the superhero,

1011
01:04:48,373 --> 01:04:50,039
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1012
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,407
Clingy?
Wow, interesting take.

1013
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:52,708
You know,
maybe sometimes

1014
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,677
a superhero just wants
a little me time.

1015
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:57,813
You know, me time
could also be construed

1016
01:04:57,815 --> 01:04:59,081
as pushing away his family.

1017
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:00,883
Family. Is that what
they are now?

1018
01:05:00,885 --> 01:05:03,019
It's a classic symptom
of "Superhero Syndrome."

1019
01:05:03,021 --> 01:05:06,722
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

1020
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:10,126
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1021
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:13,362
Son, we're still
eating dinner.

1022
01:05:13,364 --> 01:05:15,231
What he needs is a sidekick.

1023
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:17,800
Name one cool sidekick.

1024
01:05:17,802 --> 01:05:20,202
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

1025
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:22,338
You're never at a loss
for words.

1026
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,209
I'm eating.

1027
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:36,653
Why am I still doing this?

1028
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:39,255
Well,
you can't skip every day.

1029
01:05:39,257 --> 01:05:41,356
Not at your age.

1030
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,726
But I'm not your age anymore.

1031
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:45,028
But I can go with you.

1032
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:47,530
We just gotta trick the guard
out, you know?

1033
01:05:47,532 --> 01:05:49,498
Billy, where are you going?

1034
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,034
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1035
01:05:51,036 --> 01:05:52,668
Billy!

1036
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:57,039
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1037
01:06:05,782 --> 01:06:07,349
All right.

1038
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:09,084
Did you check it to...

1039
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:12,921
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

1040
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:15,494
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

1041
01:06:25,135 --> 01:06:27,369
Ooh!

1042
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:30,238
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

1043
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,541
How do you know my name?

1044
01:06:31,543 --> 01:06:34,376
Uh... How do I know
your name? Uh...

1045
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:37,179
One of my superpowers
is name guessing.

1046
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:38,981
Which is really weird, I bet.

1047
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:41,684
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

1048
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:44,686
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1049
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:45,954
Are you hurt?

1050
01:06:45,956 --> 01:06:49,862
No, I'm okay.
Thank you. Um...

1051
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,262
I just need a second to think.

1052
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:56,566
This has been
such a weird day.

1053
01:06:56,568 --> 01:07:00,068
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

1054
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,704
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1055
01:07:02,706 --> 01:07:03,873
in your hand.

1056
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,545
Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1057
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:11,150
I got in.

1058
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:15,985
Well,
now my superpowers are failing me

1059
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:17,755
and I am very confused.

1060
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:21,423
Yeah. Me, too.

1061
01:07:21,425 --> 01:07:23,425
I don't know.
I know I should be excited

1062
01:07:23,427 --> 01:07:26,397
'cause this is my dream and I've
worked really, really hard for this,

1063
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:28,400
but it's like...

1064
01:07:30,735 --> 01:07:33,403
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1065
01:07:33,405 --> 01:07:36,539
Could I give you
a little piece of advice?

1066
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:38,441
Don't be worried
about everybody else.

1067
01:07:38,443 --> 01:07:40,376
Always look out
for number one.

1068
01:07:40,378 --> 01:07:41,778
Gandhi said that.

1069
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,713
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

1070
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:45,180
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

1071
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:46,648
"Take care of number one."

1072
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,284
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

1073
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:49,952
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1074
01:07:49,954 --> 01:07:52,521
Agree to disagree.
The point is, you do you, you know?

1075
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:54,023
You gotta look out for you.

1076
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:56,295
And get as far away
from this place as you can.

1077
01:07:58,429 --> 01:07:59,896
I don't know if I want to.

1078
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:01,731
Of course you do.
What're you gonna do?

1079
01:08:01,733 --> 01:08:03,973
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

1080
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:06,936
Look, families are for people

1081
01:08:06,938 --> 01:08:09,374
who can't take care
of themselves, okay? So...

1082
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:12,409
And you can take care
of yourself.

1083
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:14,780
Also,
look both ways when you cross the street.

1084
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,784
I'll just call him.
I'll just make sure.

1085
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:26,557
It's ringing.

1086
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,660
Red Cyclone, hey!
Hey, what's going on?

1087
01:08:31,662 --> 01:08:33,362
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1088
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:36,065
Yeah, it's crazy!
Great story.

1089
01:08:37,135 --> 01:08:38,800
He's not talking to anyone.

1090
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:40,736
I was!

1091
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:43,505
I was! We're friends.
I know him, I do!

1092
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:45,741
I know him! I know him!
Uh, yeah.

1093
01:08:49,381 --> 01:08:50,582
Shit.

1094
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:56,117
Come on now.

1095
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:59,354
<i>♪ Hands!
Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1096
01:08:59,356 --> 01:09:01,490
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1097
01:09:01,492 --> 01:09:03,727
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1098
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:05,428
Hey. Hey.

1099
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,396
Hey, young man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1100
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:09,531
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

1101
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:11,233
How can I help you?

1102
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,937
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1103
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:16,973
Yeah, I got a little something called
a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

1104
01:09:16,975 --> 01:09:18,741
I don't know if
you've ever heard of it,

1105
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:21,044
but it's when someone grabs
your underwear like that

1106
01:09:21,046 --> 01:09:24,080
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

1107
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:26,816
And this was my underwear.

1108
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:30,652
Gross.

1109
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:32,088
You said you'd come.

1110
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,290
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

1111
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:35,692
I'm a superhero, dude!

1112
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:37,526
Well, you're acting
real heroic.

1113
01:09:37,528 --> 01:09:39,061
How much people
paying you today?

1114
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:42,231
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1115
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:44,799
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

1116
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:47,706
<i>♪ Hands!
Lightning with my hands! ♪</i>

1117
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,426
Oh, man!

1118
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:14,900
Holy moly.

1119
01:10:17,435 --> 01:10:20,268
Don't move! Nobody move!

1120
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:29,678
Oh, no, no!

1121
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,485
Oh, no, no, no!
Stay, stay! Stay!

1122
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:43,326
Oh!

1123
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:44,826
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

1124
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:47,597
It's him!
It's that superhero guy!

1125
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:50,534
Help us! Save us!

1126
01:10:51,002 --> 01:10:52,002
Come on!

1127
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,606
Come on... Yeah.

1128
01:10:56,608 --> 01:10:58,877
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1129
01:11:07,118 --> 01:11:08,720
No way.

1130
01:11:16,494 --> 01:11:19,329
Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1131
01:11:19,331 --> 01:11:20,696
God, this is
the worst idea ever!

1132
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:34,277
I did it! I did it!

1133
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:36,512
I got the bus! I got the bus.

1134
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:38,347
Nobody move in there.

1135
01:11:38,349 --> 01:11:40,749
Oh, I gotta put this thing down.
I gotta put this thing down.

1136
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:42,988
Oh!

1137
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,987
Oh.

1138
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:48,156
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Doggy, doggy, you have to move.

1139
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:49,858
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

1140
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,794
Please be a good dog,
good dog!

1141
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:53,396
You're being a bad dog!

1142
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:55,731
Go! Go!

1143
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:58,168
Please go. Please move.

1144
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,602
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1145
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:02,838
Thank you.

1146
01:12:17,956 --> 01:12:20,990
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1147
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:23,159
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1148
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:24,294
Thank you!

1149
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:26,562
It was kind of
my fault anyway.

1150
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,701
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1151
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:36,604
in the form of its
very own superhero.

1152
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:38,374
And we're out.

1153
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:40,175
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1154
01:12:40,177 --> 01:12:43,079
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1155
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:46,415
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1156
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:48,617
And then I caught it!

1157
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:51,754
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1158
01:12:51,756 --> 01:12:53,755
I caught a bus
like people catch fly balls.

1159
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:55,324
Like, who does that?
I do that!

1160
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:56,692
Billy! You do nothing.

1161
01:12:56,694 --> 01:13:00,129
You take selfies
and make people pay you.

1162
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:03,632
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1163
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,604
You just wish it was you.

1164
01:13:06,069 --> 01:13:07,503
No shit!

1165
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:11,473
You think?
I would kill to have what you have.

1166
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:13,375
Because everything I do
is, like,

1167
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:16,477
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1168
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:18,380
To not feel sorry for me.

1169
01:13:18,382 --> 01:13:21,851
I mean, look at me! Look at me.
Do you even see me?

1170
01:13:21,853 --> 01:13:26,522
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

1171
01:13:26,524 --> 01:13:28,723
And now you don't either.

1172
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:30,858
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1173
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,561
I mean, Billy, you're 14,

1174
01:13:32,563 --> 01:13:35,464
and now you're no better
than the Breyers.

1175
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:37,633
All this power,
and all you did

1176
01:13:37,635 --> 01:13:39,604
was turn into a show-off
and a bully.

1177
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:43,505
Whatever, kid!

1178
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:44,943
I do what I want!

1179
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:49,180
And I'm, like,
mid-20s probably!

1180
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,016
Maybe even, like, 30.

1181
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,688
Chosen one.

1182
01:14:00,457 --> 01:14:02,594
The so-called perfect man.

1183
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,163
Pure of heart.

1184
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:08,133
Flawless in every way.

1185
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:12,334
What made you so worthy?

1186
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:14,702
I'm sorry, can I help...

1187
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:16,171
Do you want an autograph
or something?

1188
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:17,876
Give me your power.

1189
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:21,376
Or die.

1190
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:24,580
Oh, snap! You're, like,
a bad guy, right?

1191
01:14:24,582 --> 01:14:28,050
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets really stupid for you,

1192
01:14:28,052 --> 01:14:30,419
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1193
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:41,464
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

1194
01:14:41,466 --> 01:14:44,165
I said, stop right there!

1195
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,103
The only thing
that extinguishes magic...

1196
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:48,404
is magic.

1197
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:52,177
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1198
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:58,379
Oh, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1199
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,382
Them's street rules.

1200
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:11,059
Okay, okay, okay.

1201
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:12,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1202
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:14,996
I never should've punched you
in the nuts like that.

1203
01:15:14,998 --> 01:15:16,031
That was totally my bad.

1204
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,532
We can talk about this.

1205
01:15:17,534 --> 01:15:19,000
You grovel like a child.

1206
01:15:19,002 --> 01:15:21,103
That's because I am one.
I'm a kid!

1207
01:15:21,105 --> 01:15:22,840
You don't wanna hurt a kid,
do you?

1208
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:28,811
I believe I can fly!
I believe I can fly, I can fly!

1209
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:30,379
Freddy said if I believe
I can fly, then I can fly.

1210
01:15:30,381 --> 01:15:32,548
So I believe!
I believe! I believe!

1211
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,516
Okay.

1212
01:15:33,518 --> 01:15:34,650
Superman!

1213
01:15:34,652 --> 01:15:36,919
Superman! What arm is it?

1214
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:38,586
Why am I not flying?

1215
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:40,190
Please, I don't wanna die!

1216
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:04,446
I'm floating!

1217
01:16:11,122 --> 01:16:12,923
What the hell
was that?

1218
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,660
I can fly!

1219
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,103
Billy?

1220
01:16:27,438 --> 01:16:29,571
Freddy! I need your help!

1221
01:16:29,573 --> 01:16:31,507
You can fly?

1222
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,383
Who's the other guy?

1223
01:16:40,385 --> 01:16:41,782
Santa!

1224
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:48,824
So, like, what do you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1225
01:16:48,826 --> 01:16:51,294
Well, in some ways,

1226
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:53,394
Santa is always here for you.

1227
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:01,870
Help Santa!

1228
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:04,706
Santa needs help! Help!

1229
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,241
Give us a shout
if you need us.

1230
01:17:13,951 --> 01:17:16,471
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1231
01:17:18,956 --> 01:17:20,688
This is crazy.

1232
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,290
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

1233
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:24,660
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1234
01:17:24,662 --> 01:17:26,965
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

1235
01:17:35,472 --> 01:17:36,873
Get back!

1236
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,408
Get away!

1237
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,413
- <i>I'm Batman!</i>
- Get him, Batman!

1238
01:17:45,048 --> 01:17:46,615
Oh, sorry.

1239
01:18:12,408 --> 01:18:13,545
Come on!

1240
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,003
Shazam!

1241
01:19:11,135 --> 01:19:12,337
Billy!

1242
01:19:13,671 --> 01:19:14,671
Billy!

1243
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:17,508
Billy, where are you?

1244
01:19:20,612 --> 01:19:21,613
Billy!

1245
01:19:22,813 --> 01:19:24,079
Where are you, Billy?

1246
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:30,188
Billy, come on!

1247
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:35,991
Billy. Where is he?

1248
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:37,393
Supervillain.

1249
01:19:37,395 --> 01:19:40,298
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1250
01:19:40,997 --> 01:19:43,932
Worse. Much worse.

1251
01:19:43,934 --> 01:19:47,535
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

1252
01:19:47,537 --> 01:19:50,938
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

1253
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,275
I don't need to read
your mind.

1254
01:19:53,277 --> 01:19:54,913
Because you are
going to tell me.

1255
01:19:55,912 --> 01:19:57,347
Where is he?

1256
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:11,826
Oh, my God,
honey, are you okay?

1257
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,662
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1258
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:15,598
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1259
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,565
Come inside.

1260
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:18,800
We need
to have a talk.

1261
01:20:18,802 --> 01:20:21,104
Just don't be
so hard on him, okay?

1262
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:29,644
Running out on us! Lying!

1263
01:20:29,646 --> 01:20:31,379
Huh? Then I get a call
from the school,

1264
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:33,516
telling me
you've been cutting class!

1265
01:20:33,518 --> 01:20:34,849
Getting in fights!

1266
01:20:38,788 --> 01:20:41,055
<i>Bill,
the man saved nine people.</i>

1267
01:20:41,057 --> 01:20:43,023
Whoa! Is that...

1268
01:20:43,025 --> 01:20:44,394
<i>I'm questioning his motive.</i>

1269
01:20:45,561 --> 01:20:47,463
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1270
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:54,237
Or what's a superhero
doing with Freddy?

1271
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,941
You remember dinner,

1272
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:00,976
when Billy and Freddy
were arguing

1273
01:21:00,978 --> 01:21:03,978
like an old married couple,
like this?

1274
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,548
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

1275
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,985
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1276
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:20,928
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1277
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,831
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1278
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,266
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1279
01:21:24,268 --> 01:21:27,001
- I didn't break any promises.
- You knew?

1280
01:21:27,003 --> 01:21:28,605
I'm a good sister!

1281
01:21:32,609 --> 01:21:35,242
I mean,
what were you thinking?

1282
01:21:35,244 --> 01:21:37,280
And then you bring
Freddy into it.

1283
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:46,224
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

1284
01:21:56,065 --> 01:21:57,268
Billy?

1285
01:22:02,273 --> 01:22:03,641
You're him.

1286
01:22:04,742 --> 01:22:06,177
You're the hero.

1287
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:09,212
Yeah, well,
not anymore, so...

1288
01:22:14,118 --> 01:22:16,487
Why do you have my notebook?

1289
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:20,158
Eugene finished your search.

1290
01:22:21,057 --> 01:22:23,392
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1291
01:22:23,394 --> 01:22:25,727
But I have played
<i>Watch Dogs</i> and <i>Uplink.</i>

1292
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:28,863
And maybe I did pick up a few
skills, which maybe did get me

1293
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:31,133
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

1294
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:33,302
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1295
01:22:33,304 --> 01:22:37,274
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1296
01:22:42,579 --> 01:22:43,844
What?

1297
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:45,746
You were born
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1298
01:22:45,748 --> 01:22:47,583
They divorced
when you were three.

1299
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:49,451
Your mom moved here
that year.

1300
01:22:49,453 --> 01:22:51,786
Twenty months later,
you got lost.

1301
01:22:51,788 --> 01:22:53,555
You never found them

1302
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:55,891
'cause your dad's been in
prison in Florida for ten years.

1303
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,261
And your mom's...

1304
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:00,131
What?

1305
01:23:01,731 --> 01:23:03,331
Is she dead?

1306
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:05,235
She's two subway stops away.

1307
01:23:06,503 --> 01:23:08,303
What?

1308
01:23:08,305 --> 01:23:11,742
You know, you didn't find her because
she reverted to her maiden name.

1309
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:18,181
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1310
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:23,451
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

1311
01:23:23,453 --> 01:23:25,689
Kids, stay here
in case Billy comes back.

1312
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:35,298
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1313
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,374
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

1314
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:49,346
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1315
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:54,318
Billy?

1316
01:23:56,819 --> 01:23:57,822
Freddy?

1317
01:24:02,324 --> 01:24:04,427
Oh, how quaint.

1318
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:09,266
Actually, I take that back.

1319
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:13,403
What a shithole.

1320
01:24:56,078 --> 01:24:57,648
Just a second.

1321
01:25:02,086 --> 01:25:04,053
Hey, look, I'm late
for work already, all right?

1322
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:06,854
We don't need any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

1323
01:25:06,856 --> 01:25:08,490
Oh, I'm not.

1324
01:25:08,492 --> 01:25:10,962
You probably
don't recognize me...

1325
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:14,298
but I found my way home.

1326
01:25:15,631 --> 01:25:16,634
Mom.

1327
01:25:18,601 --> 01:25:19,737
It's me.

1328
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,239
Oh, God.

1329
01:25:23,341 --> 01:25:24,475
Is it?

1330
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,546
Um... Hang on.

1331
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:31,982
Who's at the door?

1332
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,183
It's, um...

1333
01:25:35,185 --> 01:25:37,288
It's no one, Travis.

1334
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:43,628
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1335
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:46,460
No.

1336
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:49,300
Listen, um...

1337
01:25:51,134 --> 01:25:52,435
It's really you, huh?

1338
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:59,074
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

1339
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:02,110
I let go, but it was
by accident.

1340
01:26:02,112 --> 01:26:03,881
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1341
01:26:04,948 --> 01:26:06,050
I saw you.

1342
01:26:07,217 --> 01:26:08,485
What?

1343
01:26:11,387 --> 01:26:13,323
I saw you after.

1344
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,861
So, it was never your fault.

1345
01:26:19,863 --> 01:26:24,632
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

1346
01:26:24,634 --> 01:26:28,639
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1347
01:26:29,974 --> 01:26:32,810
<i>And I was hurting,
and I was screwed up.</i>

1348
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:36,911
- I want the tiger.
- I know.

1349
01:26:36,913 --> 01:26:38,546
I know, honey,

1350
01:26:38,548 --> 01:26:41,484
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

1351
01:26:43,921 --> 01:26:45,356
Billy?

1352
01:26:45,823 --> 01:26:46,823
Billy!

1353
01:26:47,425 --> 01:26:49,023
Billy?

1354
01:26:49,025 --> 01:26:52,027
Jesus Christ.
Billy, this isn't funny!

1355
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:53,661
Here you go, buddy.

1356
01:26:53,663 --> 01:26:56,897
That should warm you up.
Is that better?

1357
01:26:59,103 --> 01:27:02,571
<i>Look, it's just once
I saw you with the police,</i>

1358
01:27:02,573 --> 01:27:04,738
<i>I realized that they could do</i>

1359
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:07,645
<i>a better job taking care
of you than I ever will.</i>

1360
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:14,652
But you're good, right?

1361
01:27:16,286 --> 01:27:19,021
I mean,
you landed on your feet.

1362
01:27:19,023 --> 01:27:21,025
Because, I mean,
you look real good.

1363
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:24,527
It's just...

1364
01:27:26,662 --> 01:27:30,033
now is not a really good time
for me, Bill.

1365
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:39,376
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

1366
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:43,980
but I have to get back
to my real family.

1367
01:27:46,117 --> 01:27:47,118
Here.

1368
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:52,620
What's this?

1369
01:27:52,622 --> 01:27:55,824
Marilyn!
What's goin' on out there?

1370
01:27:55,826 --> 01:27:57,694
You might need it
more than me.

1371
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,946
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1372
01:28:17,948 --> 01:28:21,482
<i>Come home, Billy.
Come home.</i>

1373
01:28:21,484 --> 01:28:25,588
<i>- Billy! Supervillain!
- Supervillain!</i>

1374
01:28:41,537 --> 01:28:42,772
Shazam!

1375
01:28:56,485 --> 01:28:59,152
Who are you? What do you want?

1376
01:28:59,154 --> 01:29:00,755
What do I want?

1377
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,760
I want...

1378
01:29:07,497 --> 01:29:08,731
That.

1379
01:29:09,966 --> 01:29:11,067
Whoa.

1380
01:29:14,438 --> 01:29:16,239
Kick his ass, Billy!

1381
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:21,343
Yes, Billy.

1382
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:22,910
Try it, by all means.

1383
01:29:22,912 --> 01:29:25,013
Let them go
and I'll come inside.

1384
01:29:25,015 --> 01:29:27,281
No, first, you come inside,

1385
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:28,885
then maybe I'll let them go.

1386
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,570
Good boy.

1387
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:52,208
Because that's all you are,
isn't it?

1388
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:54,276
How old are you?

1389
01:29:54,278 --> 01:29:56,713
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

1390
01:29:58,515 --> 01:30:02,517
When I was a child,
the old man told me I wasn't good enough.

1391
01:30:02,519 --> 01:30:06,454
Yet here you are, a coward.

1392
01:30:06,456 --> 01:30:10,991
Run from me and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1393
01:30:10,993 --> 01:30:14,728
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1394
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:16,565
Give me the power
of the champion.

1395
01:30:16,567 --> 01:30:17,935
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1396
01:30:34,717 --> 01:30:37,352
Give me the power
and I'll let them go.

1397
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:39,187
Darla, no.

1398
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:41,188
Don't go, Billy.

1399
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:43,290
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

1400
01:30:43,292 --> 01:30:45,227
No, I have to.

1401
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:48,298
It's what a good brother
would do. Right?

1402
01:30:53,304 --> 01:30:54,572
Billy.

1403
01:31:20,764 --> 01:31:23,734
I dedicated
my life to getting here.

1404
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:26,768
I scoured the earth.

1405
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:28,169
No one believed me.

1406
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:30,871
No one helped.

1407
01:31:30,873 --> 01:31:32,609
Not the wizard.

1408
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:34,877
Not my family.

1409
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,946
I only had myself.

1410
01:31:38,948 --> 01:31:40,147
I get it.

1411
01:31:40,149 --> 01:31:43,220
I get what that's like.

1412
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:47,155
Feeling like
you're all alone in the world.

1413
01:31:47,157 --> 01:31:48,888
Stand.

1414
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:51,125
Feeling like there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

1415
01:31:51,127 --> 01:31:53,361
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1416
01:31:53,363 --> 01:31:54,364
Stand.

1417
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,400
The champion's name.

1418
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:01,338
Say it.

1419
01:32:28,664 --> 01:32:30,432
Look, no offense, mister,

1420
01:32:30,434 --> 01:32:32,967
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1421
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:36,338
Don't listen
to this child.

1422
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,072
Take the staff.

1423
01:32:39,074 --> 01:32:44,012
Hold it
and say the champion's name.

1424
01:32:44,014 --> 01:32:46,147
They're using you.

1425
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:48,750
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1426
01:32:48,752 --> 01:32:50,087
Say your name.

1427
01:32:53,489 --> 01:32:54,489
His name...

1428
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:57,558
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1429
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,960
And we're gonna keep
throwing things at your big,

1430
01:32:59,962 --> 01:33:01,995
fat, ugly-eyed head,

1431
01:33:01,997 --> 01:33:04,100
until you let our brother go.

1432
01:33:28,425 --> 01:33:30,625
Boy, am I glad
I didn't sell that Batarang.

1433
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:32,826
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

1434
01:33:32,828 --> 01:33:34,629
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1435
01:33:34,631 --> 01:33:36,298
Guys,
I appreciate the thought,

1436
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,031
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1437
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:39,869
You can put 'em down now.

1438
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:42,336
The door was right here.

1439
01:33:42,338 --> 01:33:44,238
Billy, how do we
get outta here?

1440
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,743
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1441
01:33:46,777 --> 01:33:47,708
This way!

1442
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,177
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1443
01:33:49,179 --> 01:33:51,278
Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

1444
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,282
Kids?

1445
01:33:53,783 --> 01:33:55,482
Why is this open?

1446
01:33:55,484 --> 01:33:57,787
Freddy? Mary?

1447
01:34:01,123 --> 01:34:02,723
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1448
01:34:02,725 --> 01:34:04,625
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

1449
01:34:04,627 --> 01:34:06,130
Darla, stay in front.

1450
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:08,065
We gotta hurry.

1451
01:34:31,587 --> 01:34:32,989
Whoa!

1452
01:34:33,823 --> 01:34:36,057
So many doors.

1453
01:34:36,059 --> 01:34:38,959
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1454
01:34:38,961 --> 01:34:40,396
Yeah, I would hope so.

1455
01:34:57,413 --> 01:34:58,447
Not this one.

1456
01:35:12,328 --> 01:35:14,461
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

1457
01:35:14,463 --> 01:35:16,664
Come on, Billy.
What are we gonna do?

1458
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:18,165
Darla, I don't know.

1459
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:20,099
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1460
01:35:20,101 --> 01:35:22,437
Uh, last time, I thought about the
subway, and I was on the subway.

1461
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:24,438
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1462
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:27,176
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1463
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,897
Come on,
come on, come on.

1464
01:35:50,899 --> 01:35:52,400
Why are you
covering my eyes?

1465
01:35:52,402 --> 01:35:55,169
Really? This is the first
place you think of? Wow!

1466
01:35:55,171 --> 01:35:56,504
You're welcome!

1467
01:35:56,506 --> 01:35:58,071
Why can't I see
what's inside?

1468
01:35:58,073 --> 01:35:59,507
You are not old enough.

1469
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:01,645
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1470
01:36:02,444 --> 01:36:03,477
Not my thing.

1471
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:04,477
Where's Freddy?

1472
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:05,981
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

1473
01:36:05,983 --> 01:36:07,682
Hey, have a holly
jolly Christmas.

1474
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:08,982
Freddy! What are you doing?

1475
01:36:08,984 --> 01:36:10,550
Nice people.

1476
01:36:10,552 --> 01:36:11,986
Nice people? Come on.

1477
01:36:11,988 --> 01:36:13,553
Is that glitter? They have glitter!
Can I get glitter?

1478
01:36:13,555 --> 01:36:14,789
No, not from them.

1479
01:36:14,791 --> 01:36:15,889
Please?

1480
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:16,891
No.

1481
01:36:18,795 --> 01:36:20,061
Darla.

1482
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:26,768
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

1483
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,335
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

1484
01:36:28,337 --> 01:36:30,107
One, two, three.
Up, up. Up we go.

1485
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:39,946
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

1486
01:36:39,948 --> 01:36:41,984
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

1487
01:36:53,529 --> 01:36:55,229
Don't run,
but don't walk. Just be cool.

1488
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:57,799
Act naturally, like kids
naturally act in a carnival.

1489
01:36:57,801 --> 01:36:59,768
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1490
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:01,701
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1491
01:37:01,703 --> 01:37:03,469
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

1492
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:05,138
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

1493
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,174
Don't take pictures.

1494
01:37:08,444 --> 01:37:09,445
Shazam!

1495
01:37:16,685 --> 01:37:18,152
Hey! Where'd he go?

1496
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:19,723
What,
is he invisible now?

1497
01:37:26,863 --> 01:37:29,763
Oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1498
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:32,735
Yo, what is that?

1499
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:37,573
Who is that guy?

1500
01:37:38,574 --> 01:37:40,775
Champion.

1501
01:37:42,878 --> 01:37:46,246
You don't deserve that name.

1502
01:37:46,248 --> 01:37:48,849
See that?
Look at that up there!

1503
01:37:48,851 --> 01:37:52,756
Hiding behind
innocent people who will now die.

1504
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:58,295
Because deep down you're still
just a scared little boy.

1505
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:02,099
Oh, no.

1506
01:38:03,131 --> 01:38:06,036
Run! Run!

1507
01:38:18,547 --> 01:38:21,215
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

1508
01:38:21,217 --> 01:38:23,116
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1509
01:38:32,094 --> 01:38:34,094
Well, you wanted
me to be a hero.

1510
01:38:34,096 --> 01:38:35,362
Are you kidding?

1511
01:38:35,364 --> 01:38:37,232
Okay, no.
Old guy's up there harboring

1512
01:38:37,234 --> 01:38:39,067
multiple spiritual entities.

1513
01:38:39,069 --> 01:38:40,701
Plus, he has
the same powers as you.

1514
01:38:40,703 --> 01:38:42,669
Plus, I mean,
he knows what he's doing.

1515
01:38:42,671 --> 01:38:45,071
Plus, I mean, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

1516
01:38:45,574 --> 01:38:48,478
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1517
01:38:49,746 --> 01:38:50,814
he's not much of a hero.

1518
01:38:55,484 --> 01:38:57,086
That was a decent catchphrase.

1519
01:38:57,921 --> 01:38:59,122
Shazam!

1520
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:09,766
Now, let's try this again.

1521
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:25,681
Or try that again!

1522
01:39:33,789 --> 01:39:34,789
Billy, look out!

1523
01:39:37,792 --> 01:39:40,260
Laser eyes!
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1524
01:39:40,262 --> 01:39:42,599
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1525
01:39:52,307 --> 01:39:53,741
That's his power matrix.

1526
01:39:53,743 --> 01:39:55,108
His what-what?

1527
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:58,412
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1528
01:39:58,414 --> 01:40:00,250
That's why
the Batarang hurt him.

1529
01:40:01,451 --> 01:40:02,215
Hey!

1530
01:40:02,217 --> 01:40:04,518
Over here!

1531
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,352
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1532
01:40:06,354 --> 01:40:07,955
We separate the Sins
from the eye,

1533
01:40:07,957 --> 01:40:09,322
and he's just an old man.

1534
01:40:09,324 --> 01:40:10,825
Gather the mutts.

1535
01:40:24,306 --> 01:40:25,705
Run!

1536
01:40:31,514 --> 01:40:33,783
Darla, no!

1537
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:50,397
Here. Take it.

1538
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:52,366
Take it. It's for you.

1539
01:40:52,368 --> 01:40:53,901
Hold it tight.

1540
01:40:53,903 --> 01:40:57,138
Close your eyes.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1541
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,842
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1542
01:40:59,609 --> 01:41:01,174
Okay.

1543
01:41:40,949 --> 01:41:41,952
Shazam!

1544
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,909
Shazam!

1545
01:42:10,945 --> 01:42:12,548
Playtime's over, boy.

1546
01:42:13,817 --> 01:42:15,482
Your friends
can't help you anymore.

1547
01:42:15,484 --> 01:42:16,819
Shazam!

1548
01:42:21,289 --> 01:42:22,692
Hey!

1549
01:42:49,318 --> 01:42:50,520
Shazam!

1550
01:43:15,077 --> 01:43:16,910
Nice trick.

1551
01:43:16,912 --> 01:43:18,379
Catchy.

1552
01:43:18,381 --> 01:43:20,347
One simple word.

1553
01:43:20,349 --> 01:43:22,085
I have a better trick.

1554
01:43:23,051 --> 01:43:24,384
Four words.

1555
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,786
Kill the little girl.

1556
01:43:26,788 --> 01:43:29,658
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

1557
01:43:33,863 --> 01:43:34,898
Stop!

1558
01:43:50,113 --> 01:43:52,979
Billy, there's
one more demon guy in his eye!

1559
01:43:52,981 --> 01:43:55,281
You gotta just rip it out
of his face hole!

1560
01:43:55,283 --> 01:43:56,518
It's where he gets his power.

1561
01:44:00,957 --> 01:44:02,359
Reach for it.

1562
01:44:03,926 --> 01:44:04,926
I dare you.

1563
01:44:14,002 --> 01:44:15,438
Wise decision.

1564
01:44:17,506 --> 01:44:19,639
Hands on the staff.

1565
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:21,909
Billy,
don't do this. Billy!

1566
01:44:21,911 --> 01:44:23,643
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

1567
01:44:23,645 --> 01:44:24,847
Don't!

1568
01:44:44,167 --> 01:44:45,566
<i>Say my name</i>

1569
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,701
<i>so my power
may flow through you.</i>

1570
01:44:47,703 --> 01:44:50,870
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1571
01:44:50,872 --> 01:44:55,276
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

1572
01:44:55,278 --> 01:44:58,979
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1573
01:44:58,981 --> 01:45:02,018
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await.

1574
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,594
All hands on deck.

1575
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,468
Say my name.

1576
01:45:19,569 --> 01:45:21,134
Billy!

1577
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:22,602
No, not my name.

1578
01:45:22,604 --> 01:45:24,404
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1579
01:45:25,173 --> 01:45:26,176
Shazam!

1580
01:46:05,047 --> 01:46:06,048
Guys.

1581
01:46:08,016 --> 01:46:09,018
What's happening?

1582
01:46:13,421 --> 01:46:14,821
I can fly!

1583
01:46:19,595 --> 01:46:20,960
Guys.

1584
01:46:20,962 --> 01:46:23,198
Check out these guns.

1585
01:46:24,166 --> 01:46:27,203
No. It's not possible.

1586
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,205
Gee-whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your cane.

1587
01:46:32,207 --> 01:46:33,576
Do you want it back?

1588
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:37,710
Guys,
I don't believe in violence,

1589
01:46:37,712 --> 01:46:41,550
but I think we should kick this guy's
butt, like, really hard.

1590
01:46:46,154 --> 01:46:47,590
Whoa!

1591
01:46:52,895 --> 01:46:54,531
Guys, I think
I can move really...

1592
01:46:55,398 --> 01:46:57,130
fast.

1593
01:46:57,132 --> 01:46:59,135
Hyper-speed! Check!

1594
01:47:08,176 --> 01:47:10,746
Billy! The eye!

1595
01:47:18,354 --> 01:47:19,586
Look out!

1596
01:47:21,658 --> 01:47:22,825
Whoa!

1597
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:27,494
What?

1598
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:28,762
- What!
- Dude!

1599
01:47:28,764 --> 01:47:31,263
You almost exploded me.

1600
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:18,778
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1601
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,350
of every single superhero.

1602
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:23,183
What do you got?

1603
01:48:26,689 --> 01:48:28,621
Well, that's terrifying.

1604
01:49:02,257 --> 01:49:05,092
Enough games, boy.

1605
01:49:05,094 --> 01:49:06,895
You think
a pack of children can...

1606
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:11,263
Wait, what?

1607
01:49:11,265 --> 01:49:13,634
You will beg for mercy

1608
01:49:13,636 --> 01:49:15,805
as I feast on your heart...

1609
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:17,737
slow.

1610
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:22,576
Are you making some big evil guy
speech right now or something?

1611
01:49:22,578 --> 01:49:26,280
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

1612
01:49:26,282 --> 01:49:29,316
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1613
01:49:29,318 --> 01:49:31,951
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1614
01:49:31,953 --> 01:49:35,757
Only I have
the power to unleash...

1615
01:49:37,493 --> 01:49:38,928
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

1616
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,193
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

1617
01:50:19,234 --> 01:50:20,401
Hi!

1618
01:50:20,403 --> 01:50:21,835
Wow. I caught you.

1619
01:50:33,082 --> 01:50:35,952
I got it. I got it.

1620
01:50:41,923 --> 01:50:43,926
Oh, my God. I do got it.

1621
01:51:00,009 --> 01:51:01,641
You're not gonna believe this,

1622
01:51:01,643 --> 01:51:03,143
but you're actually the first
villain I've ever fought.

1623
01:51:03,145 --> 01:51:05,144
It's kind of
a huge deal for me.

1624
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:21,861
Somebody help!

1625
01:51:35,677 --> 01:51:39,646
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

1626
01:51:39,648 --> 01:51:42,782
My name is Darla,
and I've been really good.

1627
01:51:42,784 --> 01:51:43,885
What?

1628
01:51:47,789 --> 01:51:49,125
Oh, crap.

1629
01:51:50,525 --> 01:51:51,491
No, no, no.

1630
01:51:51,493 --> 01:51:52,494
No, no. No!

1631
01:52:10,512 --> 01:52:12,111
No! No, no.

1632
01:52:20,154 --> 01:52:21,487
Oh, my God!

1633
01:52:21,489 --> 01:52:23,192
Is he giving us
suitcase wedgies?

1634
01:53:00,128 --> 01:53:03,229
So this is, like,
the Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1635
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:05,632
I mean, I've never
been great at math,

1636
01:53:05,634 --> 01:53:08,735
but, uh, the big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1637
01:53:08,737 --> 01:53:11,638
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1638
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,874
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

1639
01:53:14,876 --> 01:53:19,312
who I thought was gonna be way
hotter, if I'm being honest.

1640
01:53:19,314 --> 01:53:22,449
But that's only six.
Where's lucky number seven?

1641
01:53:22,451 --> 01:53:24,684
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1642
01:53:24,686 --> 01:53:27,687
Is he just scared of me and my
family because we're so awesome?

1643
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:29,254
Because I get that.

1644
01:53:29,256 --> 01:53:31,357
Like, the other sins,
they get to come out and fight

1645
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:33,527
because they're big
and strong and scary.

1646
01:53:33,529 --> 01:53:34,597
But Envy...

1647
01:53:35,898 --> 01:53:37,466
he's just the runt.

1648
01:53:49,778 --> 01:53:53,079
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

1649
01:53:53,081 --> 01:53:55,648
Because they all know
who'd win.

1650
01:53:55,650 --> 01:54:01,289
And it's not weak,
worthless, ugly Envy.

1651
01:54:27,283 --> 01:54:29,516
Gotcha.

1652
01:54:29,518 --> 01:54:30,519
Shazam!

1653
01:54:37,592 --> 01:54:38,661
Shazam!

1654
01:54:49,237 --> 01:54:51,239
Ready to go
round up your buddies?

1655
01:55:20,301 --> 01:55:23,505
No. No!

1656
01:55:53,335 --> 01:55:55,736
Here's the thing about power.

1657
01:55:55,738 --> 01:55:59,708
What good's power,
if you got nobody to share it with?

1658
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,875
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

1659
01:56:02,877 --> 01:56:05,010
- That's disgusting.
- Fatality.

1660
01:56:06,648 --> 01:56:07,981
I got the voice.

1661
01:56:11,686 --> 01:56:12,686
What's that?

1662
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,596
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1663
01:56:24,265 --> 01:56:25,766
Billy.

1664
01:56:25,768 --> 01:56:27,534
No, no, no!

1665
01:56:27,536 --> 01:56:28,867
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

1666
01:56:28,869 --> 01:56:30,336
Billy, don't do it!

1667
01:56:30,338 --> 01:56:32,338
Ah!

1668
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:34,574
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

1669
01:56:34,576 --> 01:56:36,876
You think I'm gonna put
a demon ball in my head?

1670
01:56:36,878 --> 01:56:38,510
That's disgusting.

1671
01:56:38,512 --> 01:56:40,245
That's funny. That's pretty funny.
You got me going.

1672
01:56:40,247 --> 01:56:41,915
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

1673
01:56:45,054 --> 01:56:46,054
What?

1674
01:56:47,855 --> 01:56:49,755
Oh. Hey.

1675
01:56:49,757 --> 01:56:52,858
Oh, wow.

1676
01:56:59,934 --> 01:57:01,267
All right, we did it!

1677
01:57:01,269 --> 01:57:05,474
Hey, all right, yeah!
We did it!

1678
01:57:06,341 --> 01:57:08,941
We did it!

1679
01:57:08,943 --> 01:57:11,945
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1680
01:57:11,947 --> 01:57:14,481
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

1681
01:57:14,483 --> 01:57:15,815
We're good.

1682
01:57:25,827 --> 01:57:27,762
You sure
this is gonna work?

1683
01:57:29,364 --> 01:57:31,031
Told ya.

1684
01:57:31,033 --> 01:57:32,401
Whoa!

1685
01:57:34,034 --> 01:57:35,304
Whoa!

1686
01:57:49,684 --> 01:57:51,317
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1687
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:54,486
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1688
01:57:54,488 --> 01:57:57,425
Well, yes, but also...

1689
01:57:59,461 --> 01:58:03,162
Lair! We got a lair!

1690
01:58:03,164 --> 01:58:04,429
- Lair.
- Yeah.

1691
01:58:04,431 --> 01:58:05,764
No, you right.

1692
01:58:05,766 --> 01:58:07,446
We got a lair.

1693
01:58:09,104 --> 01:58:11,236
What's a lair?

1694
01:58:11,238 --> 01:58:12,906
<i>And thanks to six superheroes,</i>

1695
01:58:12,908 --> 01:58:14,907
<i>citizens are back
in their homes,</i>

1696
01:58:14,909 --> 01:58:17,043
<i>safe again
with their families.</i>

1697
01:58:17,045 --> 01:58:19,678
<i>And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...</i>

1698
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,148
<i>It was crazy, man!</i>

1699
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,951
<i>Creatures from hell!</i>

1700
01:58:23,953 --> 01:58:26,686
<i>Lightning coming out of
everyone's everything!</i>

1701
01:58:26,688 --> 01:58:29,555
<i>And that is not
cool, man!</i>

1702
01:58:29,557 --> 01:58:31,657
So, first day
as a superhero.

1703
01:58:31,659 --> 01:58:34,760
Automatic top spot
for best ever.

1704
01:58:34,762 --> 01:58:36,763
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

1705
01:58:36,765 --> 01:58:38,999
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

1706
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:40,732
Guys.

1707
01:58:40,734 --> 01:58:42,335
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

1708
01:58:44,805 --> 01:58:46,940
Wait, wait, wait.

1709
01:58:46,942 --> 01:58:48,040
Wait.

1710
01:58:48,042 --> 01:58:49,576
Thank you for this food.

1711
01:58:49,578 --> 01:58:51,678
Thank you for this day.

1712
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,780
Thank you for this family.

1713
01:58:53,782 --> 01:58:56,182
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1714
01:58:57,386 --> 01:58:59,655
I mean, after all,

1715
01:59:00,255 --> 01:59:01,390
I'm home.

1716
01:59:33,255 --> 01:59:35,056
He better not sit
at our table.

1717
01:59:38,726 --> 01:59:39,827
Nope!

1718
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:43,032
Okay.

1719
01:59:46,501 --> 01:59:47,933
What are you doing?

1720
01:59:47,935 --> 01:59:50,236
Waiting for your imaginary BFF
to show up?

1721
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:51,670
Yeah.

1722
02:00:00,114 --> 02:00:01,447
What are you guys doing here?

1723
02:00:01,449 --> 02:00:02,915
Well, we're having lunch
with you.

1724
02:00:02,917 --> 02:00:04,851
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1725
02:00:04,853 --> 02:00:08,287
Well, we made
a very special arrangement.

1726
02:00:08,289 --> 02:00:11,891
- Darla, what's going on?
- Why are you asking me?

1727
02:00:11,893 --> 02:00:12,991
Freddy Freeman.

1728
02:00:15,262 --> 02:00:16,929
This guy

1729
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:20,599
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1730
02:00:20,601 --> 02:00:22,869
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

1731
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:27,339
What's going on,
my best bud in the whole world?

1732
02:00:27,341 --> 02:00:32,077
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

1733
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:33,479
Uh...

1734
02:00:33,481 --> 02:00:36,118
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

1735
02:03:32,726 --> 02:03:37,599
Sun of Ra.

1736
02:03:38,332 --> 02:03:44,870
Ouroboros.

1737
02:03:46,675 --> 02:03:50,376
Solomon's...

1738
02:03:50,378 --> 02:03:53,015
Knot.

1739
02:04:03,958 --> 02:04:07,593
No! No!

1740
02:04:13,667 --> 02:04:16,436
<i>Primitive symbols.</i>

1741
02:04:16,438 --> 02:04:22,008
<i>You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.</i>

1742
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:26,344
<i>You assume there's only
one way to gain magic.</i>

1743
02:04:26,346 --> 02:04:29,180
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1744
02:04:29,182 --> 02:04:32,320
<i>There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.</i>

1745
02:04:33,387 --> 02:04:35,153
What in God's name?

1746
02:04:35,155 --> 02:04:39,592
<i>I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.</i>

1747
02:04:39,594 --> 02:04:43,028
<i>Oh, what fun
we're going to have together.</i>

1748
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:47,433
<i>The Seven Realms
are about to be ours.</i>

1749
02:11:13,421 --> 02:11:16,057
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1750
02:11:16,724 --> 02:11:18,391
Yeah, I'm sure.

1751
02:11:18,393 --> 02:11:20,925
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

1752
02:11:22,396 --> 02:11:24,362
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.
