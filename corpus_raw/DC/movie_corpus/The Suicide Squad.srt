the highest mortality rate

353
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,575
in the entire
U.S. prison system.

354
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,825
[guard] Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

355
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,367
You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

356
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,158
I'm protecting this country.

357
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,283
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

358
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,200
Stand down!

359
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:52,492
[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

360
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,867
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

361
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,742
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

362
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,700
...if this mission
weren't more important

363
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,325
than you could
possibly imagine.

364
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,700
Fuck your mission.

365
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,367
You have the military
experience necessary,

366
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,992
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

367
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,575
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

368
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,408
No, I'm no fucking leader!

369
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,408
Then I'll make you one.

370
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,742
[dramatic music playing]

371
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,908
Are you in or out?

372
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,825
Good. Let's meet your team.

373
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,283
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

374
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:33,075
[guard] Let's go.

375
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,492
She was gonna kill his kid?

376
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,783
[Waller] Each member
of the team is chosen

377
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:43,492
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

378
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:47,575
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

379
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,242
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

380
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,367
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

381
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,408
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

382
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,325
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

383
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,117
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

384
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,908
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

385
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,158
But better.

386
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,408
I always hit
my targets dead center.

387
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:04,825
I hit them more in the center.

388
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,117
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

389
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,533
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

390
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:08,825
They go inside
your bullet holes

391
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,075
without even touching the side.

392
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,700
Next up is King Shark.

393
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:13,742
[Peacemaker] Holy shit.

394
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,033
What the fuck?

395
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:17,533
[Waller] Some people claim

396
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,367
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

397
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,783
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

398
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,283
Does it talk?

399
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,450
- [King Shark] Book read.
- [Bloodsport] Wow. [chuckles]

400
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,867
[Peacemaker]
Book's upside-down.

401
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,242
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

402
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,908
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

403
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,200
Be a mite careful,

404
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,117
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

405
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,992
Huh?

406
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,450
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

407
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,867
- Ratcatcher 2.
- [inmate whistles]

408
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,617
- [inmates cheering]
- Settle down!

409
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,783
Ooh.

410
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,450
What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

411
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,992
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

412
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:49,950
[knocks]

413
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,617
Cazo, will you be joining us?

414
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,617
[groans] I just woke up.

415
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,950
I don't function well
early in the morning.

416
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,658
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

417
00:20:58,742 --> 00:20:59,783
Hmm, it's all right.

418
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,825
- Get your ass out here!
- [gasps]

419
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,908
[sighs, moaning]

420
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,367
Millennials.

421
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:13,158
[continues moaning]

422
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,908
Oh, no way.

423
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:18,367
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

424
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,533
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

425
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,742
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

426
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,117
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

427
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,325
[Sebastian whines]

428
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:32,117
And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

429
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,367
What's that 'round his neck?

430
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,575
A power dampener.

431
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,408
They call him
the Polka Dot Man.

432
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,450
[scoffs] Polka Dot Man.

433
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,658
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

434
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,825
He does.

435
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:47,575
He throws polka dots at people.

436
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,033
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

437
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:51,367
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

438
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,200
You fucking pussy!
[laughing hysterically]

439
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:57,242
- [chuckles]
- These are soldiers?

440
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:58,950
We need to debrief.

441
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,242
[glass squeaking]

442
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,075
[groans] Fuck.

443
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,242
Corto Maltese

444
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:14,867
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

445
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,450
Over the past 100 years,

446
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,325
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

447
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:21,575
by the Herrera family.

448
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:25,242
But, a week ago, this guy,

449
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:28,908
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

450
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:31,742
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

451
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,408
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

452
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,742
in a violent military coup.

453
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:41,783
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

454
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,950
Although the United States
did not condone

455
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,408
the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

456
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,450
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

457
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:53,742
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

458
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,325
So, you want us to kill Luna?

459
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,533
No.

460
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,117
This is Jotunheim.

461
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,450
A scientific
experimentation facility

462
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:06,033
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

463
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,992
Our intelligence sources
tell us

464
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:11,450
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

465
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,783
In the hands
of the Luna regime,

466
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:18,283
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

467
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:22,658
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

468
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:26,450
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

469
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,825
How are we supposed to get in?

470
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,950
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

471
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,992
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

472
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:36,117
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

473
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,950
known as La Gatita Amable.

474
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,950
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

475
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,325
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

476
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:46,575
Any questions?

477
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,575
What is that?

478
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,950
[Waller] That is
an overhead projector.

479
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,533
Do you ever use it anymore?

480
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:55,908
No, not really.

481
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,992
So, why don't you
just throw it away?

482
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,783
[Waller] Peacemaker?

483
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,658
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

484
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:03,825
Think there's any connection?

485
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,408
No.

486
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:09,825
No...

487
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:10,783
Nanaue.

488
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,242
[Peacemaker] ...connection.

489
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,533
Hand.

490
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:16,992
Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

491
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,533
We're all gonna die.

492
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,450
I hope so.

493
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:26,783
Oh, for fuck's sake.

494
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,950
[dramatic music playing]

495
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,992
[explosion]

496
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,617
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

497
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,492
[Waller on radio] <i>It's just
a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

498
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,658
All right, we cut through the
jungle to get to Valle Del Mar.

499
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:59,783
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

500
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,367
That's the word.

501
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,742
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

502
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,242
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

503
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,283
You're the leader.

504
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,783
You're supposed to be decisive.

505
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:08,992
And I've decided
that you should eat

506
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,658
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

507
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,700
You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

508
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:13,908
was completely covered in dicks

509
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:15,408
and somebody said I had to eat

510
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,825
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

511
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:18,367
I would say no problemo.

512
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,117
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

513
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,450
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

514
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,783
Well, you know what I think?

515
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,242
I think liberty
is just your excuse

516
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,908
to do whatever you want.

517
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,825
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

518
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,158
Oh, yeah?

519
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,158
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

520
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:39,742
Oh, here we go.

521
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,575
There's something wrong
with your skin.

522
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:43,742
It's just a rash.

523
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:45,200
That's a rash?

524
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:48,117
[explosions]

525
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,033
[screams]

526
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,117
[grunts]

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
- [gunfire]
- [soldier shouts indistinctly]

528
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,783
