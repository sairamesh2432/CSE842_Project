1
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:14,846
<i>War and me took to each other real well.</i>

2
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:30,093
<i>It felt like it had meaning.</i>

3
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,901
<i>The feeling of doing
what you thought was right.</i>

4
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:45,940
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

5
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,247
<i>Folks can believe what they like,</i>

6
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:57,786
<i>but eventually a man's gotta decide
if he's gonna do what's right.</i>

7
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,642
<i>That choice cost me
more than I bargained for.</i>

8
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,218
Daddy!

9
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,458
Daddy!

10
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,659
- Daddy!
- Son!

11
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,495
Brave boy.

12
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,665
My son Jeb was brave. 
Loyal too.

13
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:51,101
And then he was murdered
by his best friend in cold blood.

14
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,637
Isn't that right, Hex?

15
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:54,105
Turnbull, let them go.

16
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,008
Son, you are not fit to wear this uniform.

17
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,043
You're a coward and a traitor.

18
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:03,513
Fine. I am.

19
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,214
It's got nothing to do with them.

20
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,850
- Of course it does.
- No!

21
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,785
You killed the only family I had.

22
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:10,920
No. General, please, don't do this.

23
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:14,491
Betrayed your own men
and you murdered my son.

24
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,925
I'm begging you, sir. 
I'm begging you.

25
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:21,164
You took everything that I love,
Jonah Hex.

26
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,798
You know what that feels like?

27
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,533
Don't do this.

28
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,802
It feels like this.

29
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:29,037
I want you to watch.

30
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,672
No! No!

31
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,341
No!
No!

32
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,632
You're gonna go free.

33
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,768
Free to walk this earth
with a mark on your flesh.

34
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:06,204
And every day,
that mark will remind you...

35
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,441
...of the man
who took everything you had.

36
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>I hung on that cross for days.</i>

37
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,227
<i>By the time the Crow Indians found me
and cut me down...</i>

38
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,129
<i>...I was nearly dead.</i>

39
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,732
<i>Those medicine men did
what they could to bring me back...</i>

40
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,536
<i>...but somehow they just couldn't
get me all the way out.</i>

41
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:42,806
<i>And crows seemed to stay with me.</i>

42
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,341
<i>Didn't make me immortal.</i>

43
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:49,378
<i>Just left me with the curse
of knowing the other side.</i>

44
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:55,850
<i>See, talking to dead folks ain't natural.</i>

45
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,787
<i>But sometimes they're the only ones
who will point the way.</i>

46
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:07,162
<i>I searched this land high and low,
hunting old Turnbull down.</i>

47
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:14,335
<i>But then that old bastard played one
final trick on me and died in a hotel fire.</i>

48
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,905
<i>The man that took my family was dead.</i>

49
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:23,776
<i>I had nowhere to go
and a heart full of vengeance.</i>

50
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,714
<i>I did what come natural
and turned to bounty hunting.</i>

51
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,651
<i>Punishing the guilty
wherever there was profit.</i>

52
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:42,860
<i>This here's my story.</i>

53
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,818
Jonah Hex.

54
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,990
Jonah Hex.

55
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,627
These are the boys you wanted.

56
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,164
The Clayton boys.

57
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,498
That's right.

58
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,834
Appear we have a little problem, Mr. Hex.

59
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,170
There's four Clayton boys.
This only three boys.

60
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,407
I don't see my way we could
possibly recompense you...

61
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:10,742
...the agreed upon "reconception".

62
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,617
The rest of him was too fat for my horse.

63
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,586
Well, now, Mr. Hex...

64
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:26,223
...these boys were no end of trouble
to us simple folk.

65
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:31,362
You showed me proof they was
guilty. I brought them in, simple as that.

66
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:34,430
You surely have done us quite a favor.

67
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:37,534
Transaction's all it was.

68
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,770
I'll collect my $100 bounty on them
and be on my way.

69
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:45,441
That there, Mr. Hex,
was more of a limited-time offer.

70
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,376
But you'll pay it all the same.

71
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:50,412
Oh, hell, Mr. Hex.

72
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:57,218
There's an unscrupulous man or two would
pay double that for your stinking hide.

73
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,590
Five coffins.

74
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:07,895
Sure you don't need eight?

75
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:09,229
Cut him down!

76
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,186
Congratulations.

77
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,810
- Hang it up.
- All right. I'm in.

78
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,327
Mom?

79
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:45,396
What do you suppose
those men are doing?

80
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,202
Get down!

81
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:08,452
Stay calm.
We've got them twenty to one.

82
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,066
Prepare to engage!

83
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,280
Look out!

84
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,721
I'll take out the conductor!

85
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,022
Secure the weapon!

86
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:53,494
Nobody move.

87
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,461
Everybody, get back.

88
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,585
We're slowing down.

89
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,577
You're sure, absolutely sure,
it was Turnbull?

90
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,211
Positive, President Grant.

91
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,748
Bastard must've faked his own death.

92
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,949
- Why now?
- I can hazard a guess.

93
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,153
There are centennial celebrations
being prepared in more than twenty states.

94
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:00,823
Whatever he's preparing...

95
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,626
...we've probably got ten days
to find him.

96
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:05,793
Beg your pardon...

97
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:09,097
...but why does the president care
if one old Confederate general is alive?

98
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:12,200
After Gettysburg, Turnbull changed.

99
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,169
He targeted hospitals, schools, churches.

100
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,605
Strike enough fear into people's hearts...

101
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:21,808
...and eventually they'll tear down
the government that failed to protect them.

102
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,812
His Mexican slaves
had a nickname for him.

103
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,680
- What was it?
- Terorrista.

104
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,847
Terorrista.

105
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,122
Load all that cannon onto our wagon.

106
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:40,525
Find what's left of our two boys
and give them an honorable burial.

107
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:41,960
Burn the rest.

108
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:44,997
Tell me what you know, lieutenant.

109
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,299
All we can confirm is that Turnbull
took something off that train.

110
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,905
And that he broke into the U.S. Armory
in Virginia a week before that.

111
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,605
- Summerland, Virginia?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,342
He's building it.

113
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,478
- The plans were never completed.
- He's building the weapon.

114
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,149
Sir, as you know,
my unit is the very best.

115
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:10,087
Yes, lieutenant, which is why
I need you to locate this man.

116
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:14,356
Jonah Hex?
Mm.

117
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,261
- Hex is a lawless bounty hunter.
- The man was a hero once.

118
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:22,698
- Sir, we've all heard the stories, but...
- It was Hex who turned in Turnbull and his men.

119
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,833
And he paid a terrible price for it.

120
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,036
- Sir, Turn...
- Mark my words, gentlemen.

121
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:33,341
The very fate of our nation may rest
on the shoulders of Jonah Hex.

122
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,554
He don't look so tough.

123
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,692
Looks tough to me.

124
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,365
Not to me.

125
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,502
Watch this.

126
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,171
Hey, Hex. What happened to your face?

127
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,214
Cut myself shaving.

128
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,382
What happened to yours?

129
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:24,122
For the broken window.

130
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,807
It's about time for you to move on,
Mr. Nash.

131
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,176
Grayden, please.

132
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:48,244
Door's right there.

133
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:51,515
Will you at least consider it?

134
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:54,651
I'll leave her, the store.

135
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,753
Hell, my kids.

136
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:58,621
Let's go to the city.

137
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,991
I don't play house.
Our transaction is done here.

138
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:04,392
You wanna see me,
pay fair like everyone else.

139
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,862
I don't want anybody else's hands
on you, Lilah.

140
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:13,134
- Mr. Nash.
- All right.

141
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,070
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

142
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,653
Look, buzzard...

143
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,423
Jonah Hex.

144
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,825
Lilah.

145
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,163
Get inside.

146
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,708
It's been a while, Hex.

147
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,078
Yeah, that it has.

148
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,153
You worry about me, don't you?

149
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,725
No.

150
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:25,034
Well, I worry about you.

151
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:28,671
Look how many times you've been shot.

152
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,206
It's just one more that's gonna do it.

153
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,912
Well, it seems like I've been
luckier than most in that respect.

154
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,187
Which one was the first one?

155
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:47,689
I don't recall a first or last.

156
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:56,964
Why don't we call this one number one?

157
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,899
This can be number two.

158
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:05,939
Three.

159
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,878
Four.

160
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,363
It ain't safe here, Jonah.

161
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,463
They'll be coming for you.

162
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,101
Yeah, well, they always do.

163
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,769
I saw them notices.

164
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,571
It's different this time.

165
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:42,807
You killed them lawmen.

166
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,077
They was wearing badges,
but not one of them was no lawman.

167
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:48,178
You'll hang for it...

168
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:51,180
...if the Army don't gun you down first.

169
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:56,185
Well...

170
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:59,288
...then I'll be moving on.

171
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,758
Maybe southways.

172
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,527
Of course you are.

173
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:09,163
It's paradise, you know...

174
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,168
...waiting around here on you.

175
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,939
We can go somewhere.

176
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,976
Everyone who gets close to me dies.

177
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,512
There's no future for you and me, Lilah.

178
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:29,016
Look at you, setting the rules.

179
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:42,595
You know, you shouldn't be
so sure of me, Jonah Hex.

180
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,366
Next time you come around
I may not be here.

181
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,502
It's the best I can do, Lilah.

182
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,438
Christ, woman,
how many men you seeing a day?

183
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,407
Jonah Hex?

184
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:59,744
By Presidential Act you are hereby
inducted into military service.

185
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:03,448
A reward will be offered
for the administration of your duties.

186
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,783
Your country needs you.

187
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,519
Ain't my country.

188
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:11,188
You get lost or get dead.

189
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,824
- Hex, you've got to come with us.
- No.

190
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:16,594
You can't outshoot a dozen men.

191
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,497
I might like them odds.

192
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,564
Quentin Turnbull...

193
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,501
You dare say that name to me?

194
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,373
Quentin Turnbull is alive.

195
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,594
<i>Turnbull.</i>

196
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,296
<i>He's alive.</i>

197
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:57,864
<i>I thought I'd never hear that name again.</i>

198
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,740
Thank you so much for joining us,
Mr. Hex.

199
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:12,078
The boy told me to talk to you.
Where's Turnbull?

200
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,648
The president seems to think
that you're special.

201
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,384
Magic, even. We'll just see about that.

202
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:21,353
- You don't know, do you?
- Oh, we know.

203
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:26,192
Frankly, what I don't know
is why we're even bothering with you.

204
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,260
Let me show you something.

205
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:34,999
This is the future, Hex.

206
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,802
Intelligence. Information.

207
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:41,372
With our sophisticated network,
men like you will be a thing of the past.

208
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,308
When we get this strung up...

209
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:49,579
Future's bright.

210
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,849
Now, you listen to me, bounty hunter.

211
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:55,452
I have quality intelligence that says
Turnbull and his band of bastards...

212
00:22:55,618 --> 00:22:57,386
...are headed to Springfield, Georgia.

213
00:22:57,554 --> 00:23:00,657
And how'd you come by this quality...

214
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,559
What'd you call it?

215
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,428
- Intelligence.
- Right.

216
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:09,565
Turnbull's men assaulted
one of our trains.

217
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:13,502
Yet we did manage to overcome
this one deadly outlaw.

218
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,937
Told us everything we needed to know.

219
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,941
Unfortunately he died
during our interrogation.

220
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,377
I wanna talk to him.

221
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:24,545
He's dead, Hex.

222
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:27,748
Yeah, I'll have a word with him
all the same.

223
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,696
How you doing there?

224
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:46,833
- What's happening to me?
- Afraid you're dead, friend.

225
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,368
How can you speak to me?

226
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:51,670
Well, it's kind of a knack I picked up
when l near died myself.

227
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:58,676
I can make it stop.

228
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:01,780
Just need to get some information first.

229
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:05,016
You see, what I done to you is unnatural.

230
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:09,321
I keep you out of the ground too long,
you're likely to just burn right on up.

231
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:13,691
And it seems like the fresher dead you are,
the quicker it happens.

232
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,861
Being dead, you can see
the comings and goings...

233
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,230
...of anyone you knew
when you was alive.

234
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:20,497
What do you want?

235
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,366
I'm looking for Quentin Turnbull.

236
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,335
Never knew Turnbull.

237
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,303
- Who recruited you?
- Make the pain stop.

238
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,840
- Who?
- Make the pain stop.

239
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:34,009
Who?

240
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,547
- Slocum.
- What?

241
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:41,183
Royal Slocum.

242
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:46,554
- Where?
- Runs a fight tent.

243
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:48,055
Down in South Carolina.

244
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,705
Dirt likes dead, dead likes dirt.

245
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,740
Simple as that.

246
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,678
Hey, wait.

247
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,813
What is that sound?

248
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,148
Oh, them?

249
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:19,353
Them's likely hellhounds.

250
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,654
Reckon they smell fresh meat.

251
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,291
Waiting for you for when I let you go,
no doubt.

252
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,625
No. No.

253
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,028
I wouldn't try to pet them if I was you.

254
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,900
I'm headed southeast.

255
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,238
- Thirty seconds with a dead man and...
- Ask him yourself.

256
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:42,829
Mr. Turnbull, sir.

257
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,399
I'm not sure I can deliver
what you're asking.

258
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:51,002
The reason I'm sure you'll provide what
I'm requesting is because it profits you.

259
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,939
And, son, you're no more capable
of turning down a profit...

260
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:56,408
...than a maggot is
of turning down a carcass.

261
00:26:56,574 --> 00:27:02,112
Don't worry. You're free to continue your
double-dealing in the Capitol backrooms...

262
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,817
...over fine cigars and 200-year-old malt.

263
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:09,787
But you'll continue to do
what I ask of you.

264
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,723
Mr. Turnbull...

265
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:15,726
...I've given you the routes
for every top-secret shipment...

266
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:17,361
...location of the plans...

267
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:19,796
...but this, sir, I really...

268
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,834
The hour is approaching.

269
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:28,705
Make no mistake, this country
will not see its second century.

270
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,909
And when America is in flames...

271
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:34,744
...you will be glad that you chose wisely.

272
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:43,052
You will tell me where the trigger devices
for that weapon are hidden.

273
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:03,904
Pretty orange balls.

274
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:06,940
Don't seem like much.

275
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:11,445
Aye, but they'll turn the world
to dust all the same.

276
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:12,845
Marvelous.

277
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,382
Take them, boys. But be careful.

278
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:17,750
Wouldn't want to drop them.

279
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:27,359
Grab that fella.

280
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:35,033
- Casualties?
- The soldiers are all dead.

281
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,101
-What is this?
-Oh, we found this one...

282
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:39,437
...with shoulder boards on his coat.

283
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,674
Please. Let the innocents go.

284
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,643
There are no innocents.

285
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,131
You're gonna need to
check that iron, mister.

286
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,439
All right!

287
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:22,509
This is what y'all been waiting for,
you degenerate bastards!

288
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:27,082
In this corner, the Barbarian.

289
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,985
And in this corner,
from halfway across the world:

290
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,553
The Snake-Man.

291
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:36,256
- Feed him the rattlesnake venom.
- That one! That's the one!

292
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,334
- Nice pastime you got here, colonel.
- Hex.

293
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:51,771
Come on, come on, come on.

294
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:55,173
- Yeah!
- Go on.

295
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,843
Get it done already.

296
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,381
You don't mean to kill me.

297
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:05,884
I haven't made up my mind.
Let's see how this little visit goes.

298
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,659
I'm looking for Turnbull.

299
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:18,662
Shit, Turnbull's dead.
You know that good as anyone.

300
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,164
The government said
he didn't burn in no fire.

301
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,869
You're chasing ghosts.
You should let this go.

302
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,272
You put your best friend in the grave.

303
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,875
You betrayed your regiment.

304
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:35,845
For what? Honor?

305
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:39,682
There's no honor in war.
War is killing, simple as that.

306
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,886
This country could've been ours.

307
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,487
Those days are long passed.

308
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,128
What if I told you it's not too late?

309
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:56,765
That we could still bring
this unholy union of states to its knees.

310
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,735
Don't you want a second chance?

311
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,439
All right.

312
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,175
I've decided I am gonna kill you.

313
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,580
I kind of thought that might be
your sentiments on the matter.

314
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,449
Boys.

315
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:18,884
Toss him in.

316
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,925
Slocum...

317
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:28,561
...where's Turnbull?

318
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:31,096
Why don't you ask your dead friend Jeb?

319
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:34,899
- I reckon you can catch up with him in hell.
- You know, colonel....

320
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:39,203
What a mighty good idea.

321
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:55,652
- Get him in there!
- Get in there, you mutt!

322
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,788
- Get him in the cage!
- You boys want a fair fight?

323
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:05,861
They're just jealous
of your good looks, boy.

324
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,232
Suit yourself.

325
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,334
Can't say l blame you.

326
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:20,219
Son of a...

327
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:31,597
God, you are such an asshole.

328
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,732
Good to see you again too, Jeb.

329
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:36,467
If I let you up, you promise
you won't punch me again?

330
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:39,704
Well, seems like a losing proposition
if I don't.

331
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,105
I want your word, Jeb.

332
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:44,742
- What makes you think that's any good?
- It was always good enough for me.

333
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:46,544
Go on, then.

334
00:34:47,278 --> 00:34:48,946
All right.

335
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,420
I need your help, Jeb.

336
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:00,791
- You're kidding me, right? This is a joke.
- No.

337
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,627
- You killed me, Jonah.
- You drew on me, Jeb.

338
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:05,729
Yeah, well, that was a mistake.

339
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,098
Well, obviously.

340
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:14,336
- You disobeyed a direct order.
- To burn down a hospital.

341
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:18,474
Your father was gonna murder
them people just to make a point.

342
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,509
I couldn't stand for that.
I'm surprised that you could.

343
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:24,012
He was our commanding officer.
He was my father.

344
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,847
I didn't have a choice.

345
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,249
Neither did I.

346
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,556
I'm sorry about it.

347
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,991
Killing you, I mean.

348
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:42,062
I never did expect things
would turn out that way.

349
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:46,367
He took my family in your name, Jeb.

350
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:51,137
He made me watch them die.

351
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:56,042
I gotta find him, Jeb.

352
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,311
I been watching you...

353
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:01,914
...and I been watching him.

354
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,418
It's getting real hard to tell
the difference between you two.

355
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:08,586
- Your father is a monster, you hear me?
- And you ain't?

356
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:12,890
From where I sit...

357
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:18,095
...you're just two men bent on murdering
folks to make your own pain go away.

358
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,567
Living life like that, that sounds
a hell of a lot like being damned.

359
00:36:24,535 --> 00:36:26,803
You know what he's capable of.

360
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:31,574
Oh, Jonah.

361
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,444
- He's at Fort Resurrection.
- Yeah?

362
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:35,778
He's holed up there.

363
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:40,216
I guess you two can probably
have it out once and for all.

364
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:43,486
I gotta be honest with you,
I don't even know who I'm pulling for.

365
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,589
Either way, you'll have company soon.

366
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,757
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

367
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,629
Hell. I'm starting to burn.

368
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:57,965
I best be getting back underground.

369
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,370
Now, you listen to me.

370
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,675
They talk about you down here.
You do yourself a favor.

371
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:11,078
You stay ahead of death
as long as you can, you hear?

372
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:13,914
Because they got plans for you.

373
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:15,115
Take care, Jeb.

374
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,987
See you soon.

375
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:41,573
He's never coming back for you.

376
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:43,608
You don't know that.

377
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:46,410
Who do you think told the government
he was in here?

378
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,813
You're gonna have to get out of my room.

379
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,416
You know, I bought you off
of old Jack Straw fair and legal.

380
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,119
I'm gonna do what I please.

381
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,323
I own you now.

382
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:03,459
Fool me once, dear.

383
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:24,345
Single-shot pistol, asshole.

384
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:28,651
And I ain't much for being owned.

385
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:33,388
Thank you, sir.

386
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:38,859
How do you do?

387
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:47,034
You get uglier every time I see you.

388
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,007
Lord, don't do that. You'll break
every mirror we got in stock. Come on.

389
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,612
Now, these work good.

390
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,048
You got anything new, Smith?

391
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,883
Thought you'd never ask.

392
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,522
Wow.

393
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:13,625
I take it that means you approve.

394
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,930
Big plans for the Fourth?

395
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,632
Just another day of the week is all it is.

396
00:39:23,468 --> 00:39:27,138
Jonah, you and I both know the only
reason you fought for the South...

397
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:30,507
...is you ain't like being told
what to do by the government.

398
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,876
You ain't never believed in secessionism.

399
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:36,179
And you ain't never believed
in slavery neither.

400
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:40,349
So, what's the point
in hating the Union so much?

401
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:45,488
All of them on both sides is just a bunch
of hypocrites as far as I'm concerned.

402
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:48,490
America gonna be thousand years, Jonah.

403
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:50,659
A new nation.

404
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,961
And what's good in it?

405
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,598
- The future, that's what.
- No.

406
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:59,935
Me and my boys,
we gonna go on up there to Washington...

407
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,037
...and stand in a crowd of free men...

408
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,105
...men your color skin and mine,
and listen to the president.

409
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,743
The country can keep to its own business
and I'll keep to mine.

410
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,647
I'll take them both.

411
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,754
Magnificent, isn't it?

412
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:35,791
It's bigger than a breadbox,
that's for sure.

413
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,826
Do you know who Eli Whitney was?

414
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:42,331
I'm a very undereducated man,
Mr. Turnbull.

415
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:44,599
Are we talking about
Whitney Senior or Junior?

416
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:47,101
Senior.

417
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:52,071
After he invented the cotton gin
and started the Industrial Revolution...

418
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,076
...he went to work for the U.S. military,
special projects.

419
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,945
He pioneered the use
of component parts...

420
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:01,247
...and firearms,
new combustibles for munitions...

421
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:04,949
...and more or less, he single-handedly
invented modern warfare.

422
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:06,853
So as an exercise...

423
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:11,156
...they ask him to design
a super-weapon, a nation killer.

424
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:14,893
And this is what he envisaged,
but they never made it...

425
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,462
...because once they
realized its potential...

426
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:21,466
...they decided that they could not
fathom willfully visiting...

427
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,336
...that kind of devastation
on their fellow man.

428
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:28,172
But I can.

429
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,910
And one week from now,
we will have succeeded where they failed.

430
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:36,447
On the fourth of July...

431
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:40,250
...the United States of America...

432
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:43,620
...will know hell.

433
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:46,323
Cheers.

434
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,851
Kill him.

435
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,122
Thanks, Smith.

436
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,801
Open the gates for General Turnbull!

437
00:44:14,938 --> 00:44:15,972
Sorry, Jeb.

438
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:17,807
Hex.

439
00:44:20,442 --> 00:44:22,844
Jonah-bloody-Hex.

440
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,982
I'd know that
half-cooked pie-hole anywhere.

441
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:33,488
Looks like we got ourselves
some target practice, lads.

442
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:35,590
Spread out.

443
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:10,155
Hey.

444
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:19,064
Hold your fire! 
You'll blow us all to hell!

445
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:25,504
I'm gonna hand Turnbull
your balls in a snuffbox.

446
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:29,240
Look at you. Beautiful.

447
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:32,142
Come on, up you get. Come on, flower.

448
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,744
Up.

449
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:35,045
That's it. Good man.

450
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:49,825
Is that all you got?

451
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:52,061
Really? Jonah Hex.

452
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:54,863
Jesus Christ, look at the state of you.

453
00:45:56,732 --> 00:45:59,167
You ain't going anywhere, boy.

454
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:02,503
Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll be back.

455
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:11,245
Hex?

456
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,680
Jonah Hex?

457
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:16,416
Oh, Hex!

458
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:19,853
I'm coming for you!

459
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:24,024
Hex!
Where are you, you bloody hooligan?

460
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:30,096
Yeah.

461
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,133
Don't fuss.

462
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,434
Go on, step over.

463
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:36,935
Take me home. Get.

464
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,618
Explain this to me again, Burke.

465
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:58,556
There is no explanation. I gave
the bastard two barrels straight in the chest.

466
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:01,425
By all rights, he should be
as dead as Billy here.

467
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:05,295
Well, Hex doesn't know how to die.
He'll have to be educated.

468
00:47:05,463 --> 00:47:07,131
I have no problem educating the man.

469
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:10,501
So Jonah Hex is still alive.

470
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:14,637
And somehow,
that son of a whore knows I am too.

471
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:18,208
Find me something he loves
and bring it to me.

472
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,909
Well, then.

473
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:25,949
I'll lure him to us and we'll lay his pretty
face to rot in some trench somewhere.

474
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:27,749
Stuck as a white pig.

475
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,918
That would be desirable.

476
00:47:30,553 --> 00:47:32,821
Gentlemen, this location's compromised.

477
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:35,357
Load the cream of it onto the train...

478
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:36,791
...dynamite the rest.

479
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,528
I'll get the bastard. Either way.

480
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:26,938
<i>Some say when you're just about to die...</i>

481
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,440
<i>...you play out your unfinished business.</i>

482
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:40,250
<i>Even in death, vengeance is
the one thing you can't let go.</i>

483
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,230
Hex.

484
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:58,267
Guess there's not much left
to say between us.

485
00:49:48,013 --> 00:49:49,647
Fire.

486
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:13,904
See, one day with weapons like this,
you'll be able to flatten continents.

487
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:18,108
But we gonna have to content
ourselves with starting small.

488
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:20,010
Ready, sir.

489
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:23,312
Wait for it.

490
00:50:28,884 --> 00:50:31,019
- Where?
- Just outside of Wayne County, Georgia.

491
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:33,989
- Casualties?
- Three hundred and twenty-four souls.

492
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:40,728
Military targets?

493
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:42,997
None, sir. All civilian.

494
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:47,836
Boys, get away from that.

495
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:49,203
- Look at that.
- What is it?

496
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:54,173
What's your assessment of the situation?

497
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:56,342
There are over twenty
major centennial events.

498
00:50:57,611 --> 00:50:59,446
The World's fair in Philadelphia.

499
00:50:59,779 --> 00:51:02,348
The parade in New York.
Your speech here.

500
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,717
Detonate the ordnance.

501
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,186
We've increased military
presence, but due to his willingness...

502
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:11,724
...to strike civilian targets, it is impossible
to predict where he's going to attack.

503
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,739
I don't know
how we're gonna stop him, sir.

504
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:30,473
Lovely.

505
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:35,613
<i>If I stepped in,
Then she stepped out again,</i>

506
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:37,382
<i>Learning to dance for Lanigan's ball,</i>

507
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:41,084
<i>Six long years I spent in Dublin,
Six long years doin' nothin' at all,</i>

508
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:45,055
<i>Six long years I spent in Dublin,
Learning to dance for Lanigan's ball.</i>

509
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,430
Hello there, little lamb.

510
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,101
Have you lost your flock?

511
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,905
I'm done working for the night.

512
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,047
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Just for a little fun, like.

513
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:18,954
Nobody has to get hurt.

514
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,599
Little flower, huh?

515
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:36,336
Come on.

516
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:38,071
Come on.

517
00:52:40,206 --> 00:52:42,508
You're coming with me, girl.

518
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:07,240
This one's about a war hero.

519
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:10,809
This one's about a war hero,
like you were.

520
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:13,578
This man ain't near
as handsome as me.

521
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:15,880
And where's the brave little son, Travis?

522
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:20,051
As literary form, these things is useless.

523
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:24,589
Now, I can feel your brain rotting
right below my hand right as we speak.

524
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:35,664
Help! Jonah!

525
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,302
You took everything I love, Jonah Hex.

526
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,405
Do you know what that feels like?

527
00:54:46,776 --> 00:54:48,611
It feels like this.

528
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,780
I want you to watch.

529
00:54:51,948 --> 00:54:53,749
Help! Jonah!

530
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,519
No! No! No!

531
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:20,206
Turnbull!

532
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:28,847
Send a message to Grass, lieutenant,
U.S. Army.

533
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,551
Located Turnbull. Stop.

534
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:34,853
Sailing out of Independence Harbor. Stop.

535
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:37,290
Destination unknown. Stop.

536
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:40,392
Turnbull has constructed
nation-killer weapon. Stop.

537
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:46,464
Going in alone.

538
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:49,967
Send everything you got
or thousands will die. Stop.

539
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:45,552
Whoa.

540
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:54,428
Keep him fed and watered.
Don't you tie him up.

541
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:56,896
If I don't come back for a spell,
he'll know it.

542
00:56:57,064 --> 00:56:58,532
He'll head out on his own way.

543
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,867
He got a name?

544
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:03,136
Yeah.

545
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:05,471
Horse.

546
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:07,372
You.

547
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:12,510
Yeah, I...

548
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:17,549
I don't know what to say to you.

549
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:38,167
The hell you think you're going, mister?

550
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:42,572
What happened to your fa...?

551
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:48,411
I'm about all out
of wiseass answers, friend.

552
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:09,697
Well, Mr. Turnbull, it appears the bells
are finally ready to toll on Washington.

553
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:14,335
And I hear them, Mr. Lusk,
as I've heard them for six long years.

554
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:19,139
We appreciate the services
that you have rendered to us.

555
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,608
I can only hope you succeed.

556
00:58:21,775 --> 00:58:23,877
I'll most certainly hang if you don't...

557
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:27,280
...an outcome I sincerely hope to avoid.

558
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,719
Consider it avoided.

559
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,354
- Fire it up.
- Let's go!

560
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:37,423
Fire up the engine!

561
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,059
Get ready to put her in the water!

562
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:49,834
Looks good. Come on, let's go.
Check the engine room.

563
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:24,756
You know you look like a right freak,
don't you?

564
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:29,494
Tell me, what's it like to go through life
with a face like that?

565
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:32,896
Let me show you.

566
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,544
This is for...

567
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,182
...my wife.

568
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:16,003
This is for my son!

569
01:01:25,212 --> 01:01:27,914
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

570
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:31,284
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

571
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:37,155
Gentlemen...

572
01:01:37,991 --> 01:01:40,159
...tonight we put this ship in the water.

573
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:41,360
Yeah!

574
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,364
And as we navigate the shoreline
of this precious and ruined land...

575
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,567
...let us not forget that we sail...

576
01:01:49,735 --> 01:01:51,536
...on an ocean of tears.

577
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:53,171
And when we reach the Potomac...

578
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,341
...our enemy will learn that
we have arrived to do that thing...

579
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:02,045
...which we most assuredly
were convened to do.

580
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:04,815
- Yeah!
- To make war!

581
01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:06,350
Yeah!

582
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,919
- The Capitol will burn!
- Yeah!

583
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:12,990
The battle is joined!

584
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:29,905
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

585
01:02:31,106 --> 01:02:32,707
Hex.

586
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:39,247
You know, Hex,
they say you have no heart.

587
01:02:39,415 --> 01:02:42,718
I think your problem may be
just the contrary, son.

588
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,585
You are soft.

589
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,355
You're incapable of sacrifice.

590
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,858
You wanna surrender or
you wanna watch another one die?

591
01:02:57,564 --> 01:02:58,598
That's a good boy.

592
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,405
Once a coward, always a coward.

593
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,742
Jeb says hi.

594
01:03:08,908 --> 01:03:10,943
No. I want him to watch.

595
01:03:28,693 --> 01:03:30,528
Three minutes till we're in range, sir.

596
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:45,842
Our country was new...

597
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:55,818
Four thousand yards to target.

598
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:03,993
- You still got that Derringer in your bustle?
- No, he took it.

599
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:06,427
- What about that knife in your garter?
- Took it.

600
01:04:06,795 --> 01:04:09,063
- What about that...?
- Took it all, Jonah.

601
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:12,167
Well, searched you pretty darn good,
didn't they?

602
01:04:12,334 --> 01:04:14,636
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

603
01:04:14,802 --> 01:04:16,703
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

604
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:19,173
You shout for the guard,
get him over here...

605
01:04:19,341 --> 01:04:22,177
...and use your feminine wiles
and whatnot.

606
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:24,445
When he gets close...

607
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:29,182
- What the hell?
- Tallula Black's mama didn't raise no fool.

608
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:32,386
- Tallula?
- Lilah's a nickname.

609
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,187
Tallula.

610
01:04:36,356 --> 01:04:37,390
Tallula.

611
01:04:37,556 --> 01:04:40,759
Two thousand yards to target, sir.

612
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,495
Yankee cutter, downriver.

613
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:47,298
You are now all in the custody
of the military...

614
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,635
...of the United States of America.

615
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,637
You will all be charged with treason.

616
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,705
Quentin Turnbull...

617
01:04:53,872 --> 01:04:55,640
...you can show your face first.

618
01:04:57,942 --> 01:04:59,043
Arm the weapon.

619
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,265
Fire at will.

620
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:27,036
Lieutenant.

621
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:33,741
Detonate.

622
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:50,425
Full steam ahead.

623
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:58,465
Can you shoot?

624
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:00,200
Can you?

625
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,617
Get to that gunner. I got you covered.

626
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:25,879
Target is in range!

627
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:36,822
Fire fifty rounds!

628
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,042
Detonate the ordnance!

629
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,516
<i>You're gonna go free.</i>

630
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:43,818
<i>Free to walk this earth
with a mark on your flesh.</i>

631
01:08:43,985 --> 01:08:47,388
<i>And every day,
that mark will remind you...</i>

632
01:08:47,555 --> 01:08:51,091
<i>...of the man
who took everything you had.</i>

633
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:56,965
Help! Jonah!

634
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:13,280
No! No!

635
01:10:02,525 --> 01:10:03,626
<i>I want you to watch.</i>

636
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:06,328
Watch this.

637
01:10:51,937 --> 01:10:53,471
Happy Fourth of July.

638
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:16,859
Your reward.

639
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:21,097
And full pardon.

640
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:25,602
And I'd also like you to consider this.

641
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:32,107
America needs a sheriff.

642
01:11:37,246 --> 01:11:41,450
I don't think countries
have sheriffs, exactly.

643
01:11:42,551 --> 01:11:44,185
Sir.

644
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,659
Though if you get yourself into a jam...

645
01:11:51,826 --> 01:11:53,727
...I imagine you can find me.

646
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:06,305
He offer you a job?

647
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:09,274
- Yep.
- You take it?

648
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:13,647
No. I'm not big on having a boss.

649
01:12:28,026 --> 01:12:29,961
Sorry about it, Jeb.

650
01:12:57,754 --> 01:13:02,058
<i>They say a man with vengeance
in his heart is supposed to dig two graves:</i>

651
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:06,061
<i>One for his enemy and one for himself.</i>

652
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:09,531
<i>Well, I guess mine will just have to wait.</i>
