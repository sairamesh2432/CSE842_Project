Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

415
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,986
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

416
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,887
The Sionis family name
is on

417
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,555
half the museums and
schools in Gotham.

418
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,991
And that makes him

[Harley] <i>Montoya's day is

00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,432
<i>That's him.</i>

422
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,467
He had four people killed
alone last night.

423
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,269
If Roman Sionis is
such a mastermind,

424
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,538
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

425
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,807
The Janus Corporation is

426
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,574
his father's company,
thank you.

427
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,877
And by the way,
they cut him off.

428
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,546
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

429

[Harley] <i>To make
matters worse,</i>

That's her ex.</i>

431
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,252
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

432
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,255
There's a shipment
coming in.

433
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,488
[Erickson] Drugs?

434
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,124
- A diamond.
- [Munroe] A diamond.

435
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
Wow, Montoya.
Should we call the Feds for backup?

436
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,162
[Montoya] Listen,
I had a source at the club.

437
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,829
His driver.

438
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,397
He said that Roman couldn't
stop talking about this thing.

439
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:26,632
And he said that
he overheard

440
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,732
something about
laser-encoding.

441
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,169
Now, I did some research.

442
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,904
I think
it's the Bertinelli diamond.

443
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,707
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

444
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,209
[Harley]
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

445
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,044
<i>Fifteen years ago,
one of the wealthiest</i>

446
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,846
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

447
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,548
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

448
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,683
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret</i>

449
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,054

450
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,755
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

451
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:53,460
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

452
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,161
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

453
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,564
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

454
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,566
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

455
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,202
is trying to
get his hands on it.

456
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,305
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

457
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,106
He's already
building an army.

458
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,208
If he gets the diamond,

459
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,843
he'll have all the money
and connections

460
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,045
to bribe every single
judge and cop

461
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,180
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city.

462
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,215
You said you had
someone on the inside?

you have nothing.

00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,228
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

468
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,528

rumors and a hunch?

- Well, you know,

00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:14,293
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

1217
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,797
Lotus flower!

1218
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,300
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

1219
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,436
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

1220
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,505
He knows everything
and everyone.

1221
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,273
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

1222
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,907
without Doc
knowing about it.

1223
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:32,010
And he happens to be
the only person

1224
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:33,913
who actually cares
about me.

1225
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,648
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

1226
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:37,215
She's been ordering #32

1227
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:39,418
with extra chili
for many years.

1228
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:40,552
Lesson number two,

1229
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,487
you always want
extra chili with #32.

1230
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:44,423
[whispers] So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

1231
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:47,427
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

1232
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:49,795
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

1233
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:51,764
[both] We know.

1234
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:55,268
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

1235
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:57,936
you have to show them
that you're serious.

1236
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:01,474
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

1237
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,943
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

1238
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,112
Shut that door.
Lock it.

1239
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:08,547
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

1240
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:20,860
This place...

1241
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,894
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

1242
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:24,896
...is so fucking dope.

Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

1245
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:32,972
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

1246
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,775
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

1247
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:37,976
Aren't you,
my little baby?

1248
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:40,045
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

1249
00:59:40,112 --> 00:59:42,014
I love you.

1250
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:46,952
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

1251
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:51,289

- Who, that? It's Cass.

1252
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:55,260
You're so pretty.

1253

Who's this?

1254
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:01,534
It's a beaver.

1255
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:02,601
Hmm.

1256
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:09,375
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1257

[Cassandra] What's this?

1258
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:18,518
It's art.
Don't touch.

[Cassandra] He your
ex or something?

1260

You don't know
who that is?

1261
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,161
The Joker.

1262
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:30,996
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1263
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:32,664
My former partner
in madness?

1264
01:00:32,731 --> 01:00:35,201
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1265
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:37,235
You've never heard of him?

1266
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:39,539
Well, sounds like a dick.

1267
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:43,675
Huh.

Roman's little bird.

1568
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:06,551
You little fucking bird.

1569
01:18:06,618 --> 01:18:09,287
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1570
01:18:11,122 --> 01:18:14,260
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1571
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:18,899
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1572
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,198
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1573
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:21,567
Prove it to me.

1574
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:25,136
Rip open
her little tummy.

1575
01:18:25,203 --> 01:18:26,706
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

1576
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:29,108
Now! Rip it open!

1577
01:18:31,143 --> 01:18:32,345
[Zsasz groaning]

1578
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,614

1579
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:44,724
You piece of shit!

1582
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,233
Freeze!

1583
01:18:58,104 --> 01:18:59,538
Don't fucking move.

1584
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,576
Who the fuck are you?

1585
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,818
Go get the kid.

1586
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:13,386
- All right.
- [gun cocks]

1587
01:19:13,452 --> 01:19:15,220
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Cassandra] Back the fuck up!

1588
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:17,890
- Get away from me. All of you.
- [Lance] Put that shit down.

1589
01:19:17,957 --> 01:19:19,993
Shoot them, kid.

1590
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:23,930
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1591
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:27,065
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1592
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:28,801
Okay.

1593
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:31,170
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

1594
01:19:31,237 --> 01:19:32,771
But I know
that this shit stick...

1595
01:19:32,838 --> 01:19:34,340
[Cassandra grunts]

1596
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:36,408
...just tried to gut me.

1597
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:38,411
And you.

1598
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:42,314
Thought you were different.

1599
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,484
I'm sorry, kid.

1600
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:51,591
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1601
01:19:58,564 --> 01:19:59,564
Ooh!

1602
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:01,634
Ooh, I'm back.

1603
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,603
Okay, I feel like
I've just walked in on

1604
01:20:03,668 --> 01:20:05,171
something I don't
give two shits about.

1605
01:20:05,237 --> 01:20:06,404
This guy's dead,
so I'm just

1606
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:07,908
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1607
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:10,576
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1608
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:12,778
Excuse me?
I work for Sionis?

1609
01:20:14,346 --> 01:20:17,083
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1610
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:18,516
I wasn't going
to sell the kid.

1611
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:20,219
I was going
to trade the kid.

1612
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,088
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin.
Huh?

1613
01:20:22,154 --> 01:20:23,322
I'm not proud
of what I did,

1614
01:20:23,389 --> 01:20:25,157
but I had
half the city after me.

1615
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,126
Even the fucking
Crossbow Killer.

1616
01:20:27,193 --> 01:20:28,929
I'm not
the Crossbow Killer!

1617
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,195
Whoa.

1618
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:33,033
They call me...

1619
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,667
Helena Bertinelli.

1620
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:35,600
For fuck's sake.

1621
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,737
As in
the Bertinelli massacre?

1622
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:41,807
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1623
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:49,582
[Huntress] <i>I killed Galante.</i>

[groans]

1625
01:20:53,351 --> 01:20:55,021
I killed his firing squad.

1626

[both groan]

1627
01:20:59,993 --> 01:21:02,595
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

1628
01:21:02,662 --> 01:21:03,662
[groans]

1629
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:09,802
And now I'm done.

1630
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:12,738
Bravo.

1631
01:21:17,777 --> 01:21:19,545
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1632
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:21,948
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1633
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:23,448
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1634
01:21:23,515 --> 01:21:25,851
sweetheart,
but you are not done.

1635
01:21:25,918 --> 01:21:26,987
Who do you think funded

1636
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:28,621
Galante's little
power grab, huh?

1637
01:21:28,688 --> 01:21:30,456
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1638
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:32,826
Roman killed your whole
family looking for that rock.

1639
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:35,761
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1640
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:38,463
That diamond is our only
chance of stopping him.

1641
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,698
[Cassandra] You guys.

1642
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:42,333
Hey, I think
you should see this.

1643
01:21:44,837 --> 01:21:45,872
Oh.

1644
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:47,605
It's Sionis.

1645
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:02,154
We're fucked.

1646
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,289
He bought himself an army.

1647
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:13,966
They're all here for me.

1648
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,670
Aren't they?

1649
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,078
- No.
- They're not?

1650
01:22:26,145 --> 01:22:28,346
No, they're not.

1651
01:22:28,413 --> 01:22:29,949
Do you know
what that means?

1652
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:31,550
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1653
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,052
He's after all of us.

1654
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:35,956
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1655
01:22:36,021 --> 01:22:39,257
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1656
01:22:39,324 --> 01:22:40,693
And you're dumb enough

1657
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,795
to be building
a case against him.

1658
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,597
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1659
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:47,365
and let Roman
go finger-fishing

1660
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:49,034
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1661
01:22:50,536 --> 01:22:51,971
we're gonna have
to work together.

1662
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,606
With you?

1663
01:22:54,672 --> 01:22:55,908
Yeah.

1664
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:57,475
- [crying quietly]
- We're gonna work together,

1665
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:59,011
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1666

[Montoya scoffs]

1667
01:23:03,216 --> 01:23:04,516
Okay.

1668
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:07,887
Yeah. Okay.

1669
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:11,925
Sure.

1670
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:13,359
Yes!

1671
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:15,728
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1672
01:23:15,795 --> 01:23:16,796
Mmm-hmm.

1673
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:23,335
Will this do?

1674
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:25,770
No.

1675
01:23:25,838 --> 01:23:27,640
- Not at all.

We're fucking dead.

I can't believe

1679
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:35,815
- he took it all!
- [Huntress] We're fucked.

1680
01:23:35,881 --> 01:23:38,417
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1681
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:45,826

I have funded you.
I've protected you.

01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:11,750
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1685
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:14,552
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

1686
01:24:15,787 --> 01:24:17,858
Go show those little bitches

1687
01:24:17,923 --> 01:24:21,726
you don't mess
with Roman Sionis.

Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

Gotta take care of the girls.

It's just like a sleepover. [gasps]

Hey, nice.
What the hell is up

1699
01:24:54,726 --> 01:24:55,929
with this bow
and arrow shtick?

1700
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:57,462
It's not a fucking
bow and arrow.

1701
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:58,998
It's a crossbow.
I'm not 12.

She's got rage issues.
