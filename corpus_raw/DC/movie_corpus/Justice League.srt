539
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,567
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus.

540

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1418
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:05,174
How did you get the
house back from the bank?

1419
01:46:06,542 --> 01:46:07,877
I bought the bank.

1420
01:46:10,579 --> 01:46:12,112
The whole bank?

1421
01:46:12,114 --> 01:46:14,116
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1422
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,519
What?

1423
01:46:19,521 --> 01:46:22,488
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1424
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:25,158
But my foot's in the door.

1425
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,961
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1426
01:46:27,963 --> 01:46:29,732
This is like a "job" job?

1427
01:46:30,464 --> 01:46:31,667
"Job" job.

1428
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:36,672
Look at you go.

1429
01:46:52,521 --> 01:46:54,621
(TYPING)

1430
01:46:54,623 --> 01:47:00,029
LOIS: <i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1431
01:47:01,596 --> 01:47:05,066
<i>It is the conviction that
the light will never return.</i>

1432
01:47:05,968 --> 01:47:08,667
BRUCE: Must be 100, 150 feet.

1433
01:47:08,669 --> 01:47:09,871
Must be.

1434
01:47:11,373 --> 01:47:13,239
Big round table.

1435
01:47:13,241 --> 01:47:15,110
Six chairs, right there.

1436
01:47:16,445 --> 01:47:17,713
But room for more.

1437
01:47:20,481 --> 01:47:23,449
But room for more.

1438
01:47:23,451 --> 01:47:28,023
LOIS: <i>But the light always returns
to show us things familiar.</i>

1439
01:47:29,624 --> 01:47:32,293
<i>Home, family,</i>

1440
01:47:34,029 --> 01:47:38,734
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1441
01:47:43,806 --> 01:47:48,944
<i>It shows us new possibilities and
challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1442
01:47:50,411 --> 01:47:52,378
THIEF: Yeah, and Jerry
Monasco runs the whole kit.

1443
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:54,314
I mean, he did the
Bilbao job two years ago.

1444
01:47:54,316 --> 01:47:56,315
Yeah, he has it all
in storage in Croydon.

1445
01:47:56,317 --> 01:47:58,118
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1446
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,255
LOIS: <i>This time, the
light shone on the heroes</i>

1447
01:48:01,257 --> 01:48:05,261
<i>coming out of the shadows to
tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1448
01:48:07,329 --> 01:48:12,599
<i>Our darkness was deep and
seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1449
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:16,002
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1450
01:48:16,004 --> 01:48:21,176
<i>to remind us that hope is
real, that you can see it.</i>

1451
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,217
<i>All you have to do is look</i>

1452
01:48:30,886 --> 01:48:32,154
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1453
01:48:36,859 --> 01:48:38,127
(SONIC BOOM)

1454
01:49:30,713 --> 01:49:33,814
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1455
01:49:33,816 --> 01:49:35,050
Not at all, Barry.

1456
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:37,350
Curious myself.

1457
01:49:37,352 --> 01:49:38,952
Yeah, and it's not like
a competition, you know?

1458
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:41,220
Well, it is a competition.

1459
01:49:41,222 --> 01:49:44,424
But, you know, it's not like
a macho measuring thing.

1460
01:49:44,426 --> 01:49:45,928
But if I win,
you're off the team.

1461
01:49:49,097 --> 01:49:51,233
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1462
01:49:52,033 --> 01:49:53,803
- No...
- Oof.

1463
01:49:54,904 --> 01:49:56,769
If I win,

1464
01:49:56,771 --> 01:50:00,038
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch?

1465
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,742
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1466
01:50:02,744 --> 01:50:04,045
I feel stung by that.

1467
01:50:06,013 --> 01:50:07,680
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1468
01:50:07,682 --> 01:50:08,883
Deal.

1469
01:50:09,618 --> 01:50:11,216
Which coast?

1470
01:50:11,218 --> 01:50:13,154
Ah, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1471
01:50:14,789 --> 01:50:16,021
Which is that way.

1472
01:50:16,023 --> 01:50:19,093
Because the sun and it's...

1473
01:57:59,954 --> 01:58:01,653

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1475
01:58:04,892 --> 01:58:06,725
GUARD 1: All right,
let's keep it moving.

1476
01:58:06,727 --> 01:58:08,527
GUARD 2: (ON RADIO)
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1477
01:58:09,798 --> 01:58:10,799
<i>Luthor!</i>

1478
01:58:20,075 --> 01:58:21,608
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1479
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:23,011
or I'm gonna have
to come in there.

1480
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:31,786
(LAUGHING)

1481
01:58:56,143 --> 01:58:58,510
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1482
01:58:58,512 --> 01:59:00,613
Care for a glass
of Goût de Diamants?

1483
01:59:00,615 --> 01:59:02,448
I was just celebrating
God's return

1484
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:05,217
out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1485
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:08,688
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1486
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:10,355
DEATHSTROKE: You better not
be wasting my time.

1487
01:59:10,357 --> 01:59:14,193
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1488
01:59:14,195 --> 01:59:17,032
We have to level the
playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1489
01:59:18,066 --> 01:59:19,401
To put it plainly

1490
01:59:20,968 --> 01:59:23,971
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?
