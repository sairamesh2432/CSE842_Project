people who are masks
we were driven by trauma they're
obsessed with justice because of some
injustice they suffered ergo the mask it
hides the pain I wear the mask to
protect myself right from the pain
there was a Calvary involved shooting
last night you're gonna give me the
speech now what speech I should calm
down take a breath for where Oregon yeah
there's a guy in my trunk
delightful you know why you're here
so done kicked in my door humming the
trouble in our [ __ ] car oh that is
correct that what my lawyer yeah
we don't have to do that the terrorists

Pam they had a mission don't I just
forgot Calvary has our names and
addresses
[Music]
oh please please vast penance is
conspiracy of a torture honey the head
won't spawn

from doing what those markers are trying
to start a war
