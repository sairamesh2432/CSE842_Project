The gods gave us many gifts.
One day you'll know them all.
This is where we keep them.
DIANA: It's beautiful.
Who would wield it?
Only the fiercest among us even could.
And that is not you, Diana.
DIANA: (Narrating) "You will train her harder
than any amazon before her.
Five times harder...
Ten times harder..."
Never let your guard down!
You expect the battle to be fair!
DIANA: (Narrating) "Until she is better than even you."
(Narration) DIANA: "...But she must never know the truth about what she is."
STEVE: What is this place? Who are you?
DIANA: It is our sacred duty to defend the world.
Right.
Whoever you are, you are in more danger than you think.
Be careful, Diana.
DIANA: If no one else will defend the world, then I must.
STEVE: Welcome to jolly ol' London!
It's hideous.
Yeah, it's not for everybody.
Stand back!
[GUNSHOT]
Or maybe not.
Is there anything else you want to show me?
What are you?
I am Diana of the Themyscria...
...daughter of Hippolyta.
In the name of all that is good your wrath upon this world...
...is over.
[METAL CLING]
STEVE: Yep, that's not gonna work. Please put the sword down.
-It doesnâ€™t go with the outfit. - At all.
