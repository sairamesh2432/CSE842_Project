my parents were from different worlds
and now is a product of the love that
never should have been could unite our
worlds one day
a son of the land and the son of the
Seas
my mother always knew you were special
you are part of something deeper
you are the bridge between land and sea
take your rightful place as king
[Music]
we're getting close now
oh yeah close to what dying a thirst
there's no way Atlantis with this far in
there check this place out
it's real
[Music]
nothing of course it's not working it's
been sitting here collecting dust since
before the Sahara was a desert before
the Sahara was a desert you do your best
thinking when you're not thinking at all
right now hold still
Hey what are you doing we need water
you're the closest source
[Music]
showoff I could've just peed on it
[Music]
inglis Trident resides the power of
Atlantis
if you took my power journey beyond the
edge of the world to the hidden sea
in the wrong hands
it would bring destruction
but enhance the truhair
it would unite all our kingdoms above
and below
what we've written it down first I
memorized it didn't you oh yeah
what do you just say something something
Trident the Beast has awakened the time
has come
for Lantis to rise again
[Music]

[Music]
oh is awesome
is coming to the surface
you are not going to win this
billions will die unless you help us
[Music]
I'm no leader
I'm not King
[Music]
Atlantis has always had a king now I
need something more
but what could be greater than a king
[Music]
a hero
