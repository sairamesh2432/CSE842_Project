- Robert DuBois.
He's in prison for putting Superman
in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet.
- I'm not joining your Suicide Squad.
- We'll see.
- My court date is coming up,
and Miss Waller said maybe you could help me out.
- You're threatening my daughter!
- Everyone stand down. - Miss Waller, I don't--
- Stand down!
I wouldn't take such extreme measures
if this mission weren't more important
than you could possibly imagine.
Are you in or out?
Good. Let's meet your team.
Each member is chosen for his or her own
completely unique set of abilities.
- [scoffs]
- Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two. - Good to know.
- Is this thing a dog?
- A dog?
What kind of dog do you think it is, mate?
- I'm gonna go with Afghan hound.
- Oh, my God! Is it a werewolf?
- Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?
Yo, let me out! - Hey, hey, hey!
He's not a werewolf, okay?
He's a weasel. He's harmless.
I mean, he's not harmless. He's killed 27 children,
but, you know...
- Your mission
is to destroy every trace of something
known only as Project Starfish.
Any questions?
- "Starfish" is a slang term for a butthole.
Think there's any connection?
- No.
- "No."
- All right.
Let's get it.
- [roars]
- This is suicide. - Well, that's kinda our thing.
- I'm a superhero!
- That's my dad.
- I'm gonna get you out of here alive.
- I'm going to get you out of here alive.
- Ratatouille, what do you got?
- Bird. - [pigeon coos]
- Nanaue! Stay off the comm.
