Arthur does it help they have someone to talk to
My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face
She told me I had a purpose to bring laughter and joy to the world
Is it just me or
Is it getting crazier out there
Though your heart is aching smile even though it's breaking
When there are cloud in the
sky
you'll get by but if you see
Sorrows
Maybe two
What's so funny just reach
Gotham's lost its way
What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded someone who hides behind a mask
I used to think that my life was a tragedy
It's a comedy
You just you
You
