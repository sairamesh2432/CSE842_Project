today is a day for truth the world needs
to know what happened and to know what
he stands for that kind of power is very
dangerous
let the record show that this committee
holds him responsible
that's how it starts the fever the rate
of turns good man
cruel this bat vigilantes like a one-man
right of terror you don't get to decide
what the right thing is nobody cares
about Clark Kent taking on the Batman
it means something to all some people
have to all that gives them hope
people hate what they don't understand
be their hero block be their angel be
their monument be anything they need you
things
or feet none of it
you don't owe this world a thing you
never did do you know the oldest lie in
America senator the devil's don't come
from Hell beneath us
they come from the sky
twenty years in Gotham I make good guys
are left
I'm gonna stay that way he has the power
to wipe out the entire human race
now I have to destroy it
you're gonna go to war
he is not our enemy
black and blue
God versus man
day versus night
the red capes are coming the red capes
are coming
